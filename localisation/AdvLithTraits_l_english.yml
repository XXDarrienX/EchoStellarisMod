#Monocrystal geodes
trait_monocrystal_geodes:0 "Monocrystal geodes"
trait_monocrystal_geodes_desc:0 "This species' geodes are made mostly out of a single crystalline structure, significantly reducing wear by aging and improving the toughness of this species' joints. As a side effect this increases growth rates of immature specimen."
#Purifying digestion
trait_purifying_digestion:0 "Purifying digestion"
trait_purifying_digestion_desc:0 "Through a quirk of their digestive system, this species produces high-quality alloys as their waste products"
TRAIT_LITHOID_PURIFYING_DIGESTION_EFFECTS:0 "Each pop with living standards of slavery or better produces §Y0.02§! £alloys£ per month."
#Transmutative byproducts
trait_transmutative_byproducts:0 "Transmutative byproducts"
trait_transmutative_byproducts_desc:0 "These lithoids seem to be brimming with extremely rare byproducts of their vital processes, producing numerous resources of significant industrial value."
TRAIT_LITHOID_TRANSMUTATIVE_BYPRODUCTS_EFFECTS:0 "Each pop with living standards of slavery or better produces §Y0.01§! £exotic_gases£ §Y$exotic_gases$§! £rare_crystals£ §Y$rare_crystals$§! and £volatile_motes£ §Y$volatile_motes$§! per month."
#Photoregenerative crystals
trait_photoregenerative_crystals:0 "Photoregenerative crystals"
trait_photoregenerative_crystals_desc:0 "The crystalline structures of this species are excellent at converting light into energy, drastically reducing their sustenance needs. This in general makes them more amicable as well."
trait_photoregenerative_crystals_effects:0 "Pops £pops£ have §Y40%§! reduced £minerals£ §YMineral upkeep§! \nPop £pops£ happiness £happiness£: §Y+5%§! \nArmy §Ymorale: +20%§! \nArmy §Yupkeep: -30%§! "
