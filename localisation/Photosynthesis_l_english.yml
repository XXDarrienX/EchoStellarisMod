 hungry_plants_attack.title: "Attacks on [Root.Planet.GetName]"
 hungry_plants_attack.desc: "A series of disappearances has been linked to the local population of §YCarnivorous [carnivorous_plant.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§!. After hundreds of reports of missing persons, and the appearance of a new culinary craze on the blackmarket known as "Long Pig," the Department of Enforcers reports that a band of rogue plantoids has been abducting fleshy pops and taking them to slaughterhouses to be processed and sold as meat. Lithoids and Plantoids appear to be safe from these bandits, as apparently they are too crunchy to sell. The rest of the local population is living in fear, many afraid to leave their homes. They demand immediate action be taken for their safety. \n\nThis is not likely to be last incident of this kind, as long as there is a carnivorous population the demand for meat is not going away. A [carnivorous_plant.GetSpeciesName] interviewed stated that this was merely natural, the circle of life. They also suggested that the planetary government should maintain a population of £job_livestock£ §YLivestock§!,  so that these incidents would not have to be pushed to the blackmarket."
