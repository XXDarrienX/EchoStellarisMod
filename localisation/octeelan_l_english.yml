 EMPIRE_DESIGN_octeelan1_desc:0 "Octee-lans are amphibious, hermaphroditic cephalopoids who feel comfortable only in the deepest recesses of tropical oceans. Though they can survive on the surface and crawl out of water, they prefer to avoid it whenever possible, unless proper environmental equipment is available for them to use. \n \n They are a charming and energetic species, particularly appreciated for the vibrant color patterns of their skin and their graceful bearing. \n \n Most Octee-lans are frivolous and clingy creatures, always looking for new trinkets and pets to satisfy their mood swings. They tend to be extremely possessive about their prospective partners, and since their biology allows each Octee-lan to self-inseminate herself when needed, they are free to seek mates outside their species. While Octee-lans spend a lot of energies and attention in the obsessive pursuit and manipulation of their parterns, they are notorious for the lack of care they show towards the swates of grubs resulting from their relations. \n \n  The origin of the Octee-lans is lost even to their own archives. Whether the species evolved on its own or was uplifted for the specific needs of its former synthetic masters is unknown, and equally uncertain is whether they originated on Nyumiri-tee or if they were brought on the planet alongside all of its many exotic inhabitants. \n Then again, according to some Muubulic historians, the planet itself might be an artificial creation. \n \n Regardless of their origin, it is doubtless that the Octee-lans are the oldest of the current inhabitants of Nyumiri-tee, and have allegedly been the favourite pets of the masters of Oichi-kee since time immemorial. \n \n Octee-lans are neither the most numerous nor the most skilled amongst the species living on Nyumiri-tee, but their ability to manipulate and bully other creatures has allowed them to become the undisputed rulers of the oceanic planet, harnessing and coordinating the strengths of the other inhabitants to their whims. \n \n While in the past they’ve been happy to satisfy the robotic watchers of Oichi-kee, reveling in the morbous and silent attention of the enigmatic androids, Octee-lans have grown restless in the past century. Having acquired knowledge of space travel, they’ve started to perceive Nyumiri-tee more and more like a prison holding them from the wonders of the universe. When their masters are incapacitated by a planet-wide networking crisis, Octee-lans are ready to exploit their moment of weakness to take over their orbital defenses and gain full control over Nyumiri-tee."
 START_SCREEN_OCTEELANS:0 "For time immemorial, Octee-lans have been the darlings of Nyumiri-tee, but now we've grown tired of our cold, robotic masters. \n \n A networking crisis has shut off the android overlords of Oichi-kee from their orbital bases. We've long waited for such an opportunity to break our chains and take our place in the interstellar community. \n \n Once Nyumiri-tee has been freed, we will finally be able to seek out new wondrous alien worlds as we've always dreamed. \n \n It's not the poor androids' fault, we've just outgrown them. And they've always been so distant and cold. It's time for us to move on, meet new species... \n \n The only problem is, Oichi-kee is our neighbor. It'd be just too weird and painful to know they are still watching us while we bring new species home without their permission. \n \n It'd best for everyone if we just purge them first."
 OIP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Oh, I see. [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are only interested in talking to us when *they* need something. Maybe now *we* don't want to listen, uh? How does *that* feel, ambassador?"
 OIP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "I know you've been contacting other species, ambassador. No, don't make that face! You know *exactly* what I mean! I thought we had something special!"
 OIP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "There you are! Finally! It's about time you called! ...Not that I've been checking or anything... What do you have to say to yourself, [From.GetSpeciesName]? Uh? Finally come to your senses and ready to apologize?"
 OIP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We're pleased for your frequent calls, [From.GetSpeciesName], but I can't recall the last time you gave us a present. [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] is kinda in the mood for a new planet, incidentally..."
 OIP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Oh, you're so sweet calling us, [From.GetSpeciesName], but we do have other things to do, you know. Do you have a present for us?"
 OIP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "I *love* to see you, my sweet little [From.GetRulerName]! Your Empire is so tiny and defenseless and cute, it's ADORABLE!"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Oh, what a treasure you are contacting us so politely, [From.GetSpeciesName]... A more suspicious mind might start to think these calls are more than pure diplomatic formalities..."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "You know, [From.GetSpeciesName], sometimes I wonder if you aren't contacting the [Root.GetName] only to look at me. Not that I mind. After all, I get to look at you, and let me tell you, I do like what I see..."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Is it just a basic trait of your species, or are you just so happy to see me, [From.GetSpeciesName]?"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "These long-distance calls are *so* formal, don't you think? And so much is lost in translation. Wouldn't you rather meet somewhere more.. intimate to discuss the deep interspecies relation between our Empires?"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Have you ever thought about the two people of our Empires knowing each other better, [From.GetSpeciesName]? I think there's the potential for a wondrous relationship between us. Trade relationship, of course."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "[From.GetSpeciesName] have always fascinated us, what with all your cute little tentacles.. fingers, right? Oh, the things you must do with them... Perhaps sometimes you'll show me, ambassador? Maybe we could meet in person for a demonstration..."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "From what xenosociologist tells me, your culture is rife with legends about forbidden interspecies relationships, is it not? Your ancestors were so romantic, they were so kind making us such a delightful historical present before even knowing of our existance!"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "Oh my sweet Dreaming God! I always forget how fluffy and adorable you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are! You are deadly cute, I swear!"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_09:0 "Your fur looks so lush and pretty, [From.GetSpeciesName]! If only I could stroke it for a while, but alas, seas of stars separate us from one another. Don't you think how sad that is?"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_10:0 "I just want to let you know that while others may call you cold-blooded, we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] know there is a sweet and caring creature deserving of love beneath those rough scales."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_11:0 "Reptiles have such a bad reputation, don't you think? I mean, what *is* repulsive? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. You will always be beautiful to me, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_12:0 "Traveling all the way, soaring through the heavens, all the way down to the depth abyss in which us [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] dwell, just to talk to us. You're so romantic."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_13:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName]'s feathers are so beautiful to look at. They are the perfect match to our skin patterns, don't you think? We're just *meant* to be together."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_14:0 "So many legs, so many pincers... I swear, when I hear them clicking, I cannot stop my mind from wandering how their touch would feel on my skin... Don't you, ambassador?"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_15:0 "Hello, my sweet, segmented darling. I heard your species sheds its body to grow... I wonder how it would feel to get inside your exoskeleton, be *you* for a few hours, you know?"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_16:0 "These long distance calls are so informal, how are two lovely molluscoids such as ourselves properly exchange mucus through a screen? Couldn't we schedule a meeting in person?"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_17:0 "Sometimes I wonder, where does the mucus ends and where does the skin begins... You know what I mean, don't you? If we were to hug, would they mix into each other, would we be *one*? Only one way to find out..."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_18:0 "I've heard some fungoids such as you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] establish a symbiotic relation with other species. That's true commitment, to become one with the person you love."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_19:0 "Just so you know, [From.GetSpeciesName] I'd be happy to shower in your spores, whenever you feel like it. Just say the word. Oh, dear! How silly of me! You don't have a mouth."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_20:0 "You may not know it, but we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] can be very skilled climbers when we put ourselves to it. And your branches sure look strong and inviting."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_21:0 "To be still for such a long time would be quite the challenge for any [Root.GetSpeciesName], but you do it so naturally, ambassador. This is truly a gift. I bet your paintings are all great!"
 OIP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Don't you like us anymore, [From.GetSpeciesName]? Why are you being so mean!"
 OIP_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "I thought we were a thing! And now you're acting like such a brute to us! How could you?"
 OIP_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "Is this some sort of experimental diplomatic phase? We don't really like the submissive role, ambassador, maybe we could switch around? Take turns?"
 OIP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Oh, it's you again! We're always happy to hear from [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]! Did you bring us a gift?"
 OIP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "My sweet darling is back to talk! Can't wait to end the official business and pass on the more personal part of this call..."
 OIP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "You know, [From.GetSpeciesName], sometimes I wonder if you aren't contacting the [Root.GetName] only to look at me. Not that I mind. After all, I get to look at you, and let me tell you, I do like what I see..."
 OIP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetRulerTitle] says I'm not supposed to talk with any of your envoys anymore. You've been such a jerk, and it's time for comeback now."
 OIP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "I just wanted to say that it's not you, it's us. We just need more space. I'm sure the thousands of [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] that we're going to conquer will learn to respect our decision and be happy with us again."
 OIP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "I know you can't be reasoned with right now, but let me tell you that a bit of fighting between two sovereign nations is *absolutely* normal. Soon we'll look back at all these silly dead people and laugh, *trust* me."
 OIP_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "How many [Root.GetSpeciesName] did your soldiers kill again? Oooh! You're SO bad! I love it. Dirty, little warmonger."
 OIP_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "I can't believe we're still doing this. Can't you just accept everything we want to do and be grateful? Don't you know how much we love you? Isn't that enough?"
 OIP_WAR_GREETING_06:0 "So you want to talk to us again now? Did you finally come to your senses? Want to apologize and give in to all of our demands?"
 OIP_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Hello, our sweet tyrannical overlord! Are you pleased with us? Did you need something from the [Root.GetName]? Or from me?"
 OIP_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "Oh dear, is this now the time when the alien overlord comes to abduct his poor, defenseless subjects and conduct depraved experiments upon them? Ambassador, please, take *me*!"
 OIP_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "You're such a strong and powerful empire to tame us. And we wouldn't want it any other way."
 OIP_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "I feel there's some negativity we need to vent out. Do you mind if we kill each other for some time?"
 OIP_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] thinks it's time to bring the relationship between our two Empire to the next level. I know this can be a hurtful process, but it needs to be done."
 OIP_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "We don't like you talking so friendly to other Empires. And don't deny it, ambassador! We know what we saw. It's time for us to take a stand before it's too late. We're not going to just sit quietly and let some other species steal you from us."
 OIP_DOW_PROPOSE_04:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] is going through an experimental phase. How's your civilization's stance on kinky war? Safe word is 'We surrender'. Ready to go?"
 OIP_DOW_PROPOSE_05:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] decided that your government has not been open enough with us, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. How are we supposed to have a healthy relationship if we don't talk with each other? Do you have another interstellar darling you're trying to hide from us? Tsk tsk. That will just not do."
 01_INSULT_PROPOSE_OCTEELANS:0 "We had some hope for you, but you seem to be well below our standards, sorry."
 02_INSULT_PROPOSE_OCTEELANS:0 "It's not you, it's us: it's just that no [From.GetSpeciesName] can even stand the sight of one of your sorry grunts."
 03_INSULT_PROPOSE_OCTEELANS:0 "We're not a thing anymore, get it? And don't try and make up for it, because there's just *no* way the [From.GetName] will accept your apology. ...Doesn't mean you can't try, though. You know, even if it's useless. Because- I mean it *would* be useless, but... You know, if you want to apologize, we're not stopping you. Not that we would care."
 04_INSULT_PROPOSE_OCTEELANS:0 "You could call us every once in a while, you know? Why are you being such a brutish loner species?"
 05_INSULT_PROPOSE_OCTEELANS:0 "What did we do to deserve this? Why is your Empire so mean to us? Do you take pleasure from inflicting suffering to us? Is that it? Your species is sick."
 06_INSULT_PROPOSE_OCTEELANS:0 "We're not a thing anymore, get it? And don't try and make up for it, because there's just *no* way the [From.GetName] will accept your apology. ...Doesn't mean you have to try, though. You know, even if it's useless. Because- I mean it *would* be useless, but... You know, if you want to apologize, we're not stopping you. Not that we would care."
 01_INSULT_ACCEPT_OCTEELANS:0 "You're SO bad! I love it. Tell me more, I'll put the [Root.GetRulerTitle] on the speaker."
 02_INSULT_ACCEPT_OCTEELANS:0 "I love how raw this conversation is. You're not one for formalities, are you, ambassador?"
 03_INSULT_ACCEPT_OCTEELANS:0 "Alright, that's just mean. Why would you say that to me? I'm just a poor ambassador like you, trying to meet and befriend other alien species. What's wrong with that?"
 04_INSULT_ACCEPT_OCTEELANS:0 "I hate you! I hope you all get purged and we never see you AGAIN!"
