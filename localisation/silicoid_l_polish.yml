 trait_silicoid:0 "Silicoid"
 trait_silicoid_desc:0 "Silicoid life forms have a very slow metabolism and require minerals to maintain their bodies in addition to normal food. They compensate with a much more durable frame and adaptive capabilities."

 trait_sparkly_desc:0 "§LMembers of this species grow into symmetrical and shimmering shapes that considered aesthetically pleasing by most life forms.§!\n"
 trait_grotesque:0 "Grotesque"
 trait_grotesque_desc:0 "§LMembers of this species present abnormal and asymmetrical outgrowths that make them look especially alien and distant to other life forms.§!\n"

 trait_demanding_structure:0 "Demanding Structure"
 trait_demanding_structure_desc:0 "§LMembers of this species possess bulky and poorly optimized bodies, filled with redundant systems and unneeded outgrowths that require them to consume a lot more minerals for sustenace compared to other silicoids.§!\n"
 trait_idealized_structure:0 "Idealized Structure"
 trait_idealized_structure_desc:0 "§LMembers of this species have evolved with a tight and well-optimized molecular structure, minimizing the metabolic issues silicoid life forms often have to contend with.§!\n"
 trait_electroid:0 "Electroid"
 trait_electroid_desc:0 "§LMembers of this species, rather than requiring a mineral outake like most silicoids, have evolved to naturally attract and consume electricity to sustain their bodies, in addition to regular food.§!\n"
 trait_rooted:0 "Rooted"
 trait_rooted_desc:0 "§LMembers of this species spend most of their lives in a symbiotic relationship with the earth they've grown out of, making them extremely slow to relocate.§!\n"

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire1:0 "Taclariotan Influence"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_silicoid_empire1_desc:0 "The ephemeral inhabitants of Taclaarat have a long history of tribalistic warfare and technological competition. \n\n Taclariota are big and lean silicoid with a glassy look and sharp features. They are cautious and untrustworthy around other species, often perceived as rough and imperfect when compared to their crystalline structure. \n\n Despite their tribalistic competition, individual Taclariota understand perfectly the need for cooperation and are happy to obey their superiors, working together against their enemies.\n\n Having been unified only in the last century, the Taclariotan species has undergone a series of political and racial purges via brutal terraforming of their own continental masses, finally finding peace under the iron grip of a technocratic royal line. "
