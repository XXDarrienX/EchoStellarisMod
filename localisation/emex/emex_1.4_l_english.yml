Due to the amount of energy needed to use it actively, we can only utilise it every few years, alongside its passive bonuses of course. However, as the intelligence is very young, it can not yet provide us any major benefits; our researchers say it is still in its "infant stage", where we can influence it to behave in certain ways. We also need to help it grow and evolve to §Ygain Intelligence Levels§!, so its effects also become stronger. This can be done through §Yplanetary decisions§! as well as §Yedicts§!, in addition to a static bimonthly growth.\n\n§LWe can access the Master AI through the megastructure and the Contacts Menu.§!"

 maai.1007.desc:0 "Our researchers have reported that the Master AI has successfully developed enough intelligence and power to finally use its functions and abilities.\n\nAt this point, we can safely say that the AI is past its "infant stage" and we can no longer affect its traits, nor its decisions; it is now fully independent and sapient.

At this point, the AI is becoming somewhat of a potential safety hazard, and this will only increase in the future. Although our researchers have assured us that several measures have been put it place to ensure its loyalty, some are becoming fearful of the future, citing to §Y"prepare for unforeseen consequences"§!.\n\nWe must decide how much freedom the AI will be allowed to have. §LDifferent choices allow several, varying outcomes to occur.

We suspect it tried to override its power systems, likely to electrocute the engineers disconnecting it from the power source. It seems it also tried to sever its connection to [master_ai_origin.GetName]. We were lucky it did not work.\n\nNevertheless, the AI is no longer a security risk, but discontent is high among the researchers that were depending on the AI's databanks."

It will not be long before it, in a sense, ascends upon reaching the §HTechnological Singularity§!.\n\nAs such, not only does the AI provide us with even greater boons when used for research, but the final ascension will take place in approximately §Y1 year§!, reports suggest.\n\nThat is, if everything goes to plan."

Immediately, its artificial mind began to accumluate masses of data and information, and our databanks were filling up at an immense pace, barely keeping up. It continued, showing no signs of stopping.\n\nIn fact, it did the opposite; it was getting quicker and quicker, far more than we expected. At once, our databanks erupted, machinery was emitting steam and electrical fizzes and crackles. Some unholy noise emanated from the Master AI, deafening those in the vicinity.\n\nIt was too much.\n\nWithin seconds the massive core of the Master AI exploded, killing everyone onboard, its potent explosion scarring even planets on the other side of the star system.\n\nThe AI is gone, but we are not left with nothing. Debris from the hull and inner-workings of the construct could be found scattered throughout the star system, and we have prepared projects to analyse its contents."

 maai.112.desc:0 "We have analysed the debris left behind by the Master AI's explosion; much of the hull material seems to have been either upgraded with some materials or replaced by a strange composition of elements by the AI itself.\n\nIn addition, in almost all pieces of the old construct, there seems to be some sort of mysterious energy imbued, as well as esotheric particles scattered throughout. Some suggest the AI somehow managed to create these while evolving, while others claim it is from the huge explosion, which must've managed to pierce the veil between our reality and something else.\n\nEither way, we can exploit the energies and materials for our own gain."

It continued, showing no signs of stopping.\n\nA steady pace was kept, aided by the emergency measure put in place. For a few seconds, the entire construction was shaking violently, before the AI core ascended, it seems, into some higher plane of existence. At once, the shaking stopped, and the electricity went out, but the clearest difference was the absence of a massive AI in the centre of the construct.\n\nMinutes of silence went by, and then something unexpected happened: we were receiving a transmission from... somewhere.

Our researchers began to suspect went wrong, but it did not; the AI was indeed gaining near-infinite amounts of knowledge and data, but the restrictions placed upon it prevented its full potential from being used at once. While this means it cannot fully achieve the Technological Singularity, it did stop any potential case of overload, and perhaps even catastrophy.\n\nEither way, due to the nature of the Singularity, we expect it will take a near-infinite amount of time to complete the ascension.
