 civic.6.desc:0 "Our worship of holy machines and divine metal has a long history within our nation, beginning ever since the first automatons were produced. It is our one, true religion.\n\nAnd yet, ever since we first began our ventures into the cosmos, there were those who doubt. Those who would prefer seeing their own heretical beliefs reflected in our government. But we shall not let them.\n\nA grand political faction praising the Machine God and its teachings has been formed, with several high-ranking government officials and tech-priests joining together for a great cause. We will ensure our beliefs stand the test of time."

 civic.7.desc:0 "Our nation has believed the cycle of life and death something that is a certainty for most, the afterlife being the one true constant in the hostile universe. Death is something that must be welcomed, after all.\n\nLong ago, our great leaders devoted themselves to the role of reaper; we are those who will break this cycle to maintain it for others, and guard the holy afterlife for all. We must not diverge from our ancient principles; a strong coalition of powers is needed.\n\nThe newly formed nihilist faction will ensure our beliefs will live on, and they will garner any and all support required."
 civic.7.a:0 "Indeed."
