 EMPIRE_DESIGN_octeelan1_desc: "Octee-lans are amphibious, hermaphroditic cephalopods who feel comfortable only in the deepest recesses of tropical oceans. Though they can survive on the surface and crawl out of water, they prefer to avoid it whenever possible, unless proper environmental equipment is available for them to use.\n\nThey are a charming and energetic species, particularly appreciated for the vibrant color patterns of their skin and their graceful bearing.\n\nMost Octee-lans are frivolous and clingy creatures, always looking for new trinkets and pets to satisfy their mood swings. They tend to be extremely possessive about their prospective partners, and since their biology allows each Octee-lan to self-inseminate herself when needed, they are free to seek mates outside their species. While Octee-lans spend a lot of energies and attention in the obsessive pursuit and manipulation of their partners, they are notorious for the lack of care they show towards the swathes of paralarvae resulting from their relations.\n\nThe origin of the Octee-lans is lost even to their own archives. Whether the species evolved on its own or was uplifted for the specific needs of its former synthetic masters is unknown, and equally uncertain is whether they originated on Nyumiri-tee or if they were brought on the planet alongside all of its many exotic inhabitants.\n\nThen again, according to some Muubulic historians, the planet itself might be an artificial creation.\n\nRegardless of their origin, it is doubtless that the Octee-lans are the oldest of the current inhabitants of Nyumiri-tee, and have allegedly been the favourite pets of the masters of Oichi-kee since time immemorial.\n\nOctee-lans are neither the most numerous nor the most skilled amongst the species living on Nyumiri-tee, but their ability to manipulate and bully other creatures has allowed them to become the undisputed rulers of the oceanic planet, harnessing and coordinating the strengths of the other inhabitants to their whims.\n\nWhile in the past they've been happy to satisfy the synthetic watchers of Oichi-kee, reveling in the marvelous and silent attention of the enigmatic synthetics, Octee-lans have grown restless in the past century. Having acquired knowledge of space travel, they've started to perceive Nyumiri-tee more and more like a prison holding them from the wonders of the universe. When their masters are incapacitated by a planet-wide networking crisis, Octee-lans are ready to exploit their moment of weakness to take over their orbital defenses and gain full control over Nyumiri-tee."
 START_SCREEN_OCTEELANS: "For time immemorial, Octee-lans have been the darlings of Nyumiri-tee, but now we've grown tired of our cold, robotic masters.\n\nA networking crisis has shut off the synthetic overlords of Oichi-kee from their orbital bases. We've long waited for such an opportunity to break our chains and take our place in the interstellar community.\n\nOnce Nyumiri-tee has been freed, we will finally be able to seek out new wondrous alien worlds as we've always dreamed.\n\nIt's not the poor synthetics' fault, we've just outgrown them. And they've always been so distant and cold. It's time for us to move on, meet new species...\n\nThe only problem is, Oichi-kee is our neighbor. It'd be just too weird and painful to know they are still watching us while we bring new species home without their permission.\n\nIt'd best for everyone if we just purge them first."
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04: "These long-distance calls are *so* formal, don't you think? And so much is lost in translation. Wouldn't you rather meet somewhere more... intimate to discuss the deep interspecies relation between our Empires?"
 OIP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06: "[From.GetSpeciesName] have always fascinated us, what with all your cute little tentacles... fingers, right? Oh, the things you must do with them... Perhaps sometimes you'll show me, ambassador? Maybe we could meet in person for a demonstration..."
 OIP_DOW_PROPOSE_04: "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] is going through an experimental phase. How's your civilization's stance on kinky war? Safe word is 'We surrender.' Ready to go?"
