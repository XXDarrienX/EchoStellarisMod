 EMPIRE_DESIGN_holofrixit1_desc: "Holofrixits trace their origins to the frozen caverns of Zixiprat, an abandoned planet surrounded by the torn remains of ancient battleships and the ruins of forgotten civilizations.\n\nA seamless union between organic and cybernetic matter, the Holofrixits are a young but prolific species. United under the Xechiros, the free-thinking administrative caste, they have quickly overrun the desolate, arctic plains of their homeworld, greedily feeding on electrical discharges pouring from the power plants of their predecessors.\n\nWith the resources of their homeworld depleted, the rulers of the Holosphere started to turn their gaze to the stars. Able to phase in and out of a virtual reality of their own making, the Holofrixits have started to create holographic starfleets, plugging their conciousness in their servers and projecting themselves into space..."

 trait_holofrixit: "Holofrixit"
 trait_holofrixit_desc: "§LA form of synthobiologic arthropoid. Holofrixits require energy to sustain themselves, are able to phase out of existance, and to transfer their memories on cybernetic hardware. Their bodies have a relatively low durability, but they make up for it with their high birthrate.\n\nThe Holofrixit species is divided in strict castes.\n\n- The Drones and Warriors, at the bottom of the genetic pyramid, are employed for physical labor, and are only capable of collective thought patterns.\n- The Ganglions, although capable of independent thought, are sterile and lack any assertive impulses, and thus tend to occupy the middle roles of researchers and overseers.\n- Only the Xechiros of the administrative caste, born with a full emotional and cognitive spectrum, are able to lead and coordinate the efforts of each hive.§!\n"
