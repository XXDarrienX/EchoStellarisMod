They evolved on a temperate world as a vegetarian species, their diet being made up of mostly sugary fruit. \n \n They are short humanoids with a weak frame and a youthful appearance, fond of recoloring and modifying their own body to meet their aesthetic needs. \n \n Having unified their conglomerate Nations through social media, they quickly moved to the stars, already set on welcoming and integrating new friendly species within their Astral Concordate. \n \n While not outright Pacifists, Xirmians use diplomacy and political maneuvering as their main weapons, taking a pragmatic and moderate approach to the interplanetary power games, forging strong alliances while isolating and surgically removing those they cannot reason with."

I think it is a testament to the foresight of both our species."
 XFD_NEUTRAL_GREETING_15:0 "Sorry, I don't want to give you the wrong impression. It's just- bugs freak me out, ok? There! I said it. I know it's superficial, and I'm sure you're a wonderful person inside, but- gh-! Just.. just tell me what you need."

 XFD_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "Hi! All fine, your Overlordship? Do you need to yank the chain of your servants so often to feel confident about yourself? Sure you're not compensating for anything?"
