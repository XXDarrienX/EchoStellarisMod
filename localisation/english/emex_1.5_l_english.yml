 bok.7.desc:0 "It seems that much of the surface of [bok_poi2_planet.GetName] still has buildings and sectors that are either partly functioning or at the very least will aid in establishing proper districts and such. Apart from the obvious collapsed buildings, we could not find any signs of sentient life, alive or dead. We suspect there are corpses and remains beneath the rubble and surface, but it is not plausible to attempt to conduct a search.\n\nWhatever caused the death of the inhabitants here clearly happened long ago."

As such, the Infinite Intelligence Core has been repurposed for colonisation purposes, and is now ready to land on a suitable world. As we are machines, §Lany world, regardless of habitability levels, can be colonised§!.\n\nIn addition, to begin to construct an armada and civilian force, we must construct starbases around stars soon."

In fact, our drones have devised a way to utilise organic matter to improve the efficiency of our research drones: the §YBio-Matter Research Sector§!\n\nIn addition, due to our enrichment of the planet's natural flora and fauna, a multitude of new planetary features have revealed themselves.
