 EMPIRE_DESIGN_romaneagles1_desc: "Aquilesi are prideful and shrewd people, evolved from an avian species of solitary predators from Enchiria. They are natural leaders, fierce and charismatic, but only when dealing with other, more peaceful species.\n\nOnce divided in many tribes, they have slowly coalesced into a single Empire after generations of tighter and tighter trade agreements between their former Nation-States. Their society is based on discipline and competition, rewarding excellence with socio-political advancement.\n\nAquilesi are ready to brave the unknown depths of space, discover new species and conquer them for the glory of the Empire."

Our military flocks shall turn into fierce, interstellar fleets, ensuring the Pax Enchiriaca to reach every uncivilized corner of the universe.\n\nAll Aquilesi are ready to do their part and fight for the glory of the Empire.\n\nLet this new era of interstellar conquest begin!"
