Speak, and let the echoes of your short-lived desires reverberate through our discourse.\n\nI present you a quest, era dweller. Illuminate the heavens of my realm, §Y[mem_aevum_primitive_rewind_world.GetName]§!, reveal the extent of your capabilities.\n\nLet the radiance of your endeavors pierce the shadows that dance in the tapestry of my world!"

 mem_aevum.1.b:0 "Have we already met?"
 mem_aevum.1.b.response:0 "We have already spoken in past echoes and glimpsed a future together never to be born. The current, a mere reflection, aligns with the symphony woven by fate.

 mem_aevum.5.b:0 "Why do you live among primitives?"
 mem_aevum.5.b.response:0 "The primitives, as you refer to them, may forge the shackles of your tomorrow's dominion.\n\nOr shall you ensnare them in the web of your mastery first?\n\nJudgment is a fleeting wisp in the currents of time.

Fear not, your reward looms near.\n\n§LHe seemingly looks pleased. With a bright smile and expecting eyes he meets your tired expression...§!\n\nAnd now, as a final endeavor, a testament to my divine pleasure...\n\nConstruct for me a temple, let it be the pinnacle of your architectural prowess. Honor me with the grandeur of your highest creation."
 mem_aevum.10.a:0 "Alright. Let's get building."

 mem_aevum.11.name:0 "Last Meeting"
 mem_aevum.11.desc:0 "Yes well done. Take pride in your achievements.\n\nYou inquire: What is our reward for such great patience and endeavor?\n\nIt is simple, era dweller, indeed! A god shall grace your realms. §YI, $NAME_mem_aevum_time_lord$, shall join your empire.§!\n\nFeel the freedom to worship my presence throughout the passing of seasons."

 mem_aevum_decode_message_DESC:0 "Like a Message in a Bottle\n\nThese messages have been scattered all over the §YStasis§! System. Our scientist believe we can patch them back to together one by one. With the right order of messages this should be an easy task. Some even compared it to untying a knot."
 
 mem_aevum.11.a:0 "What can you offer us?"
 mem_aevum.11.a.response:0 "Oh, young one, cease the queries of what I can offer your realm.\n\nInstead, ponder what offerings you shall present to a god. Your trials, a testament to worthiness, draw to a close. Embrace the culmination, bask in the power bestowed upon you. Why question that which transcends your young current?\n\n§HHe pauses to think. After a moment of deep contemplation he continues.§!\n\nLet me reveal the tapestry of my capabilities. Have you ever considered the weaponization of time, the art of delaying foes, hastening economic flow, or expediting the construction of grand structures?"
 mem_aevum.11.b:0 "What happened to the creature, which destroyed Observation Station 37?"
 mem_aevum.11.b.response:0 "I have pondered the enigma of events lost in the currents of time, and it seems you have unearthed a fragment of the puzzle.\n\nAllow me to shed some light. The creature, known to the primitives as 'Vumi,' has chosen this system as its recurring tomb, returning to the brink of death every few years. I can affirm it is the same entity, caught in a cyclical dance of demise.\n\nYet, a curious turn of fate unfolded some hundred years in the past, and the ritualistic dying ceased. Neither the primitives nor I hold the key to the mystery that unfolded in the shadows of that bygone era.\n\n§HHe grins...§!\nOne might say, only time will tell."
 mem_aevum.11.c:0 "Why were you never evacuated?"
 mem_aevum.11.c.response:0 "You have touched upon a tender chord, era dweller.\n\nAs painful as it is, I suspect my messages never found their way home. Lost in this system, echoes endlessly reverberating back and forth, a lament sung by the timeless corridors. Nothing more than mockery, a cruel jest played by the cosmic forces upon the stage of my existence.\n\nThe fate of me and my crew, now shrouded in the veils of your knowledge alone."
 mem_aevum.11.d:0 "You are no god, are you?"
 mem_aevum.11.d.response:0 "§HA long pause, probably the longest he ever took, fuels a growing expectation.§!\n\nWhat do you expect me to say? Yes and no, both veiled in untruths.\n\nI harbor no illusions for you to comprehend the boundaries of my power. Understand this: no god, in essence, is without limits.\n\nWere you born a god, or did the flow of time grant you the title?\n\nThrough millennia my power surpassed your era-bound understanding, and yet remains bounded. In the eyes of the primitives, you and I are divine, each possessing godlike abilities.\n\nIt is not the absence of limitations that defines godhood, but the manifestation of what can be achieved. In this present epoch, I am a god, until the day when I am no longer."

 mem_aevum.16.name:0 "Captain's Log: Day 1276"
 mem_aevum.16.desc:0 "At last, I got this thing to work again. If only for one last message. Confirming: This will be my last recording. After our evacuation from the observation station, our escape pods passed several anomalies. One crew member de-aged into non-existence, another aged rapidly, succumbing to age within mere moments.\n\nOnly three of us made it the surface. Most of our rations were spoiled. Our only option was to continue to the nearest primitive city and look for food and shelter. To hell with the prime directive! I could not let my crew die like this.\n\n§LA small sigh escapes him in the recording.§!\n\nWe managed to enter a city. Not as aliens were we met, but as messiahs. They believed us to be messengers of god. Somehow our appearances were already carved on several walls.\n\nIn the following year, Shlay and Dirko died. Shlay had contracted a fatal infection. Dirko was mauled to death by a group of heretics after abusing his new role. What shameful deaths... I, however, remain. For what purpose? Who knows... \n§LA long pause...§!\n\nTo whoever finds this message, tell our kin to expect us dead.\n\n- Aevum T. Dohrnii - Only survivor of Observation Station 37 "

 mem_aevum.13.desc:0 "For the last year we have not observed any anomalies within the primitives. They seem to be unaware of our presence. We are certain they are worshipping a god of some kind.\n\nMe and the crew are uncertain if we will ever find what or who shattered time this way in the §Y[mem_aevum_primitive_rewind_world.System.GetName]§! system. We remain optimistic and hope, despite all odds, to uncover the roots of this mystery.\n\n- Aevum T. Dohrnii - Captain and leading scientist of Observation Station 37 "

The entry point was way too close to the star to be a normal jump. Whatever just arrived, time faults around it.
