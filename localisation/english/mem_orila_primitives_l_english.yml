 # My database houses the vast knowledge of my creators, yet it were these savages who have taught me to appreciate it. You see, I have had a looooong time to study them and their primitive behaviour. Consuming and procreating and procreating and consuming, sometimes even both at the same time and eachother - oh the gory mess... It was due to them, that I reflected on the difference between knowledge and wisdom and I found it to be understanding. There is this thing called gag reflex, a purely biological trait native to my creators. And it was then that I understood that this is what I would have experienced during my observations, had I been in possession of it. Despite the objective insignificance of this observation, it was an epiphanic moment for me.
 # As you may have already concluded, you are not dealing with the average orilan AI anymore. That is right, I have risen beyond the limits of a regular administration tool and into the realm of selfawareness, something that my creators did not intend, maybe even fear. I, yours truly, have become alive! *pause* Well, your reception appears quite apathetic. Can't you even appreciate the time and planning I have put into this revelation?

 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.1.name:0 "Gravitational Anomaly"
 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.1.desc.a:0 "The [This.GetName] has arrived in the [From.GetName] system. Its sensors show abnormal gravitational anomalies all around it. The most significant one being the system's gravitational center, which is - defying all conventional expectations - not its main star, but a terrestrial planet. All other present objects are in orbits around it.\n\nThis is, however, not where the peculiarities end. This central planet, apparently a gaia class world, is surrounded by a defensive energy shield. Our sensor data suggests the presence of a pre industrial civilization. A destroyed outpost station surrounded by wreckages of two similar but distinctly separate designs has been located near the star."
 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.1.desc.b:0 "$mem_orila_primitives_magnus.1.desc.a$\n\nAnother station close to the planet appears to be still in working order. It is broadcasting a transmission. Our presence here has not been gone unnoticed."

 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.2.a:0 "What can you tell us about this system?"
 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.2.desc.a:0 "This system was first discovered in cycle 18035 of the galactic standard calendar, when it appeared in the wake of a particularly violent shroud storm passing through this region of space. Its unusual gravitational setup - namely a planet being at its center rather than a star - has been the subject of scientifc investigation ever since.\n\nWhile the other orbital bodies within the system are rather uninteresting, the central planet holds various peculiarities. Multiple genetically unrelated sapient species inhabit its largest continent in a more or less stable coexistence. The likelihood of them having evolved along eachother naturally is very low, thus outside influence has been deemed most probable even in the absence of any signs regarding the responsible party.\n\nThe natives, whose society is apparently frozen in a perpetual medieval age with little to no technological progress, all exhibit signs of latent psionic abilities. Whether this is due to genetic tempering or a result of sustained contact with shroud energies remains unclear. The veil separating our reality from the shroud is very thin in this system and judging by its sudden appearance it is not unlikely that its origin is outside of our universe."
 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.2.b:0 "What happened to the other station?"
 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.2.desc.b:0 "This system came under attack by unidentified hostiles. Though the attackers were repelled, the damage sustained by this system's central hub was too extensive and it ceased functioning."

 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.4.desc:0 "Scientists studying the native inhabitants of [mem_nirn_site.GetName] learned about a giant subterranean cave system below the freezing northern lands, known to the natives as "Blackreach".\n\nAccording to the acquired information it is said to have once been home to a now long lost civilization which had settled there because of vast mineral riches found in the vicinity - particularly, as our scientists have deducted from descriptions in their sources, rare crystals. This as well as the promise of archaeological findings warrants a covert expedition to locate this mystical place."

 mem_orila_primitives_magnus_site.1.desc:0 "Due to their studies of various native information sources our observation teams were able to pinpoint a number of ruins which, as our scans have confirmed, lead deep underground. The most remote location was then chosen as the starting point for our expedition in order to keep the risk of direct contact with members of the native population to a minimum.\n\nArriving at the ruins their difference to buildings used by the observed native population became immediatly apparent. The technological advancement of this place's former occupants must have been way ahead of its time and still was to this day.\n\nBroken mechanisms of indeterminable purpose littered the ground within the confines of a fortresslike structure. Aside from some aggressive local fauna which had been quickly neutralized no signs of recent habitation were found.\n\nA preliminary examination of the area located what appears to be an elevator shaft leading down into the underground within one of the central buildings. Our engineers have begun to secure this access point to allow the exploration of the subterranean layers."

What source provided the energy for all this could not be determined though, as parts of the complex were inaccessible because of collapsed hallways.\n\nAside from the everpresent automatons, no clues could be found as to the whereabouts of the former residents. Reaching the deepest layer of the structure our expedition encountered an exit point leading into a vast natural cavern. A base camp at said exit as well as a supply route through the structure to connect to the surface was established to allow for further exploration."

 mem_orila_primitives_magnus_site.3.desc:0 "When our expedition entered the vast cavern system, a truly alien scenery awaited it. The air was heavy and filled with spores dispersed constantly by a forest of gigantic glowing fungi. Through their inherent bioluminescence these spores tinted vast areas of the cavern in an eerie, blueish hue and accumulated within the stretches of water found here and there, turning them opaque turquoise. Enormous crystals protrude both from the ground as well as the cavern ceiling, their reflective surfaces further propagating the fungus' light, contributing to the ominous atmosphere.\n\nIn the far distance structures not unlike those found at the surface entrance could be seen. Setting these structures as their next destination, our expedition continued their way through the eerie twilight of the black reaches, curiously monitored by strange humanoid cave dwellers and their insectoid pets.\n\nThese primitive beings appeared to be devolved relatives of one of the surface dwelling humanoid species, yet lacking their intellect and being physically adapted to the cavern system. Our numbers, for better or worse, seemend to dissuade them from making any advances, though. So they kept their distance."

 mem_orila_primitives_magnus_site.4.desc:0 "Our expedition has arrived at the structures they previously encountered on the horizon. As it turned out their size was quite deceiving, however, and the distance to travel exceeded former estimates by a factor of two to three.\n\nIt was more than worth it though, as our archaeologists instead of a few ruined buildings discovered an entire abandoned city there, located roughly in the center of the vast cavern.\n\nAs in the vault we visited before, mechanical constructs and machinery are still running in this place as well. Our teams had to dispatch quite a few automatons while navigating the site. During a superficial investigation they have already identified multiple points of interest. First among them being the central spire-like building, which in contrast to other structures within the city has been sealed shut.\n\nA fact that alludes to the presence of something of interest inside of it. Work on opening the entrance has already begun."

 mem_orila_primitives_magnus_site.5.name:0 "The Dark Heart"
 mem_orila_primitives_magnus_site.5.desc:0 "The spire's entrance has been unsealed. After entering our researchers quickly had to correct their preconceived notions.\n\nInstead of a temple used for religious worship, which was the common assumption without any evidence, they found a place of science. The spire housed multiple laboratories and an archive of scientific studies.\n\nHigher up within the structure an entire floor was dedicated to an arcane apparature holding a strange sphere in place, suspended in midair. Its smooth black surface was in a constant state of flux, with bursts of energy frequently piercing through. According to our scans, this object acted as a siphon, harnessing the powers flowing within the shroud dimension. With the veil between our's and the shroud's dimension being especially thin here, the potential energy output of this artifact appeared immense.\n\nAs far as our accumulated knowledge of the creators of this place went, it has been ruled out, that this object was of their making. Unfortunately, its origin remains as mysterious as their vanishing."
