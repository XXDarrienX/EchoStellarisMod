 mem_orila_primitives.20a.desc:0 "We have arrived in the §Y[From.GetName]§! system and immediatly picked up various debris fields on our fleet's sensors. A preliminary analysis deems the wreckages ancient yet highly advanced. It appears, however, as if we weren't the first to come upon these remnants. They were already stripped clean of any usefull components long ago.\n\nThis is not the only peculiarity though, as one of the system's planets was broken into pieces at some point in its past. It is unclear what had caused this to happen, but it appears likely, the debris spread throughout the system stems from the same event. Further investigation is recommended."
 # only seen another destroyed planet so far
 mem_orila_primitives.20b.desc:0 "We have arrived in another devastated system and found another broken world. The wreckages found within the system appear ancient yet highly advanced. Unfortunately though they have been picked clean of any usefull components long before our arrival.\n\nA brief scan of the vicinity has revealed traces of the heavy element alloys we have found before. This planet must have fallen victim to the same force."

Another world had fallen victim to their reign of terror."

 # My database houses the vast knowledge of my creators, yet it were these savages who have taught me to appreciate it. You see, I have had a looooong time to study them and their primitive behaviour. Consuming and procreating and procreating and consuming, sometimes even both at the same time and eachother - oh the gory mess... It was due to them, that I reflected on the difference between knowledge and wisdom and I found it to be understanding. There is this thing called gag reflex, a purely biological trait native to my creators. And it was then that I understood that this is what I would have experienced during my observations, had I been in possession of it. Despite the objective insignificance of this observation, it was an epiphanic moment for me.
 # As you may have already concluded, you are not dealing with the average orilan AI anymore. That is right, I have risen beyond the limits of a regular administration tool and into the realm of selfawareness, something that my creators did not intend, maybe even fear. I, yours truly, have become alive! *pause* Well, your reception appears quite apathetic. Can't you even appreciate the time and planning I have put into this revelation?
