 # My database houses the vast knowledge of my creators, yet it were these savages who have taught me to appreciate it. You see, I have had a looooong time to study them and their primitive behaviour. Consuming and procreating and procreating and consuming, sometimes even both at the same time and eachother - oh the gory mess... It was due to them, that I reflected on the difference between knowledge and wisdom and I found it to be understanding. There is this thing called gag reflex, a purely biological trait native to my creators. And it was then that I understood that this is what I would have experienced during my observations, had I been in possession of it. Despite the objective insignificance of this observation, it was an epiphanic moment for me.
 # As you may have already concluded, you are not dealing with the average orilan AI anymore. That is right, I have risen beyond the limits of a regular administration tool and into the realm of selfawareness, something that my creators did not intend, maybe even fear.

 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.1.name:0 "Gravitational Anomaly"
 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.1.desc.a:0 "The [This.GetName] has arrived in the [From.GetName] system. Its sensors show abnormal gravitational anomalies all around it. The most significant one being the system's gravitational center, which is - defying all conventional expectations - not its main star, but a terrestrial planet. All other present objects are in orbits around it.\n\nThis is, however, not where the peculiarities end. This central planet, apparently a gaia class world, is surrounded by a defensive energy shield. Our sensor data suggests the presence of a pre industrial civilization. A destroyed outpost station surrounded by wreckages of two similar but distinctly separate designs has been located near the star."
 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.1.desc.b:0 "$mem_orila_primitives_magnus.1.desc.a$\n\nAnother station close to the planet appears to be still in working order. It is broadcasting a transmission. Our presence here has not been gone unnoticed."

 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.2.a:0 "What can you tell us about this system?"
 mem_orila_primitives_magnus.2.desc.a:0 "This system was first discovered in cycle 18035 of the galactic standard calendar, when it appeared in the wake of a particularly violent shroud storm passing through this region of space. Its unusual gravitational setup - namely a planet being at its center rather than a star - has been the subject of scientifc investigation ever since.\n\nWhile the other orbital bodies within the system are rather uninteresting, the central planet holds various peculiarities. Multiple genetically unrelated sapient species inhabit its largest continent in a more or less stable coexistence. The likelihood of them having evolved along eachother naturally is very low, thus outside influence has been deemed most probable even in the absence of any signs regarding the responsible party.\n\nThe natives, whose society is apparently frozen in a perpetual medieval age with little to no technological progress, all exhibit signs of latent psionic abilities. Whether this is due to genetic tempering or a result of sustained contact with shroud energies remains unclear. The veil separating our reality from the shroud is very thin in this system and judging by its sudden appearance it is not unlikely that its origin is outside of our universe."

This as well as the promise of archaeological findings warrants a covert expedition to locate this mystical place."

The most remote location was then chosen as the starting point for our expedition in order to keep the risk of direct contact with members of the native population to a minimum.\n\nArriving at the ruins their difference to buildings used by the observed native population became immediatly apparent. The technological advancement of this place's former occupants must have been way ahead of its time and still was to this day.\n\nBroken mechanisms of indeterminable purpose littered the ground within the confines of a fortresslike structure. Aside from some aggressive local fauna which had been quickly neutralized no signs of recent habitation were found.\n\nA preliminary examination of the area located what appears to be an elevator shaft leading down into the underground within one of the central buildings. Our engineers have begun to secure this access point to allow the exploration of the subterranean layers."

What source provided the energy for all this could not be determined though, as parts of the complex were inaccessible because of collapsed hallways.\n\nAside from the everpresent automatons, no clues could be found as to the whereabouts of the former residents. Reaching the deepest layer of the structure our expedition encountered an exit point leading into a vast natural cavern. A base camp at said exit as well as a supply route through the structure to connect to the surface was established to allow for further exploration."

The air was heavy and filled with spores dispersed constantly by a forest of gigantic glowing fungi. Through their inherent bioluminescence these spores tinted vast areas of the cavern in an eerie, blueish hue and accumulated within the stretches of water found here and there, turning them opaque turquoise. Enormous crystals protrude both from the ground as well as the cavern ceiling, their reflective surfaces further propagating the fungus' light, contributing to the ominous atmosphere.\n\nIn the far distance structures not unlike those found at the surface entrance could be seen. Setting these structures as their next destination, our expedition continued their way through the eerie twilight of the black reaches, curiously monitored by strange humanoid cave dwellers and their insectoid pets.\n\nThese primitive beings appeared to be devolved relatives of one of the surface dwelling humanoid species, yet lacking their intellect and being physically adapted to the cavern system. Our numbers, for better or worse, seemend to dissuade them from making any advances, though. So they kept their distance."

As it turned out their size was quite deceiving, however, and the distance to travel exceeded former estimates by a factor of two to three.\n\nIt was more than worth it though, as our archaeologists instead of a few ruined buildings discovered an entire abandoned city there, located roughly in the center of the vast cavern.\n\nAs in the vault we visited before, mechanical constructs and machinery are still running in this place as well. Our teams had to dispatch quite a few automatons while navigating the site. During a superficial investigation they have already identified multiple points of interest. First among them being the central spire-like building, which in contrast to other structures within the city has been sealed shut.\n\nA fact that alludes to the presence of something of interest inside of it. Work on opening the entrance has already begun."

After entering our researchers quickly had to correct their preconceived notions.\n\nInstead of a temple used for religious worship, which was the common assumption without any evidence, they found a place of science. The spire housed multiple laboratories and an archive of scientific studies.\n\nHigher up within the structure an entire floor was dedicated to an arcane apparature holding a strange sphere in place, suspended in midair. Its smooth black surface was in a constant state of flux, with bursts of energy frequently piercing through. According to our scans, this object acted as a siphon, harnessing the powers flowing within the shroud dimension. With the veil between our's and the shroud's dimension being especially thin here, the potential energy output of this artifact appeared immense.\n\nAs far as our accumulated knowledge of the creators of this place went, it has been ruled out, that this object was of their making. Unfortunately, its origin remains as mysterious as their vanishing."

The planetary shield around [From.Planet.GetName] makes it difficult to determine the nature of these constructs from afar.\n\nFurther on site investigations could help us understand their purpose."
 # Stage 1
 mem_orila_primitives_pebbles_site.1.name:0 "Lifeless Cities"
 mem_orila_primitives_pebbles_site.1.desc:0 "Our scientists have examined at least a couple dozens of these massive structures which they deem to have been floating cities. Curiously no sign of sapient life was anywhere to be found. The interiors of most houses were decorated with elaborate sculptures - probably respresenting the local population - yet still no clues as to the whereabout of their former inhabitants could be obtained.\n\nFurther scans in the wider area around our previous investigations located structures similar in design to the floating cities, but built deep inside the mountain ranges of one of the few existing archipelagos of this world."
 # Stage 2
 mem_orila_primitives_pebbles_site.2.name:0 "Mountain Bunkers"
 mem_orila_primitives_pebbles_site.2.desc:0 "The constructions inside the mountain range are abandoned as well. As far as our understanding of these "bunkers" goes, they appear to have been built under time pressure with little concern for luxuries or magnificent architecture. Everything within screams "utility".\n\nIt appears that the former residents of the mountain ranges had barricaded themself against a flood. It is unclear for how long the barricades resisted the rising tides, but eventually the lower levels were flooded, leaving only the upper levels habitable. A strange commonality between the various bunkers our teams had explored, is the seemingly out of place presence of statues similar to those found on the floating cities. Even more curious is their placement solely in the unflooded areas as if the former inhabitants - who again left no traces of themselves - amidst their hardship had made it their highest priority to preserve them."
 # Stage 3
 mem_orila_primitives_pebbles_site.3.name:0 "Rainy With a Chance of Steaming Fog"
 mem_orila_primitives_pebbles_site.3.desc:0 "Our probes have found the presumed main cause of the risen tides. A super-geysir located in the northern parts of [From.Planet.GetName]. Even though it is now submerged by the ocean, the geysir of steam and boiling water continuously breaks through the waves, reaching heights of over 100 meters. Our team estimates that the thermic energy released by this geysir over time gradually increased this planet's atmospheric temperature, melting all the ice around the polar regions. According to our calculations, [From.Planet.GetName] without this constant release of energy would be a frozen desert without any water in liquid form.\n\nOur scientist's theory is that the native population facing the emergence and following rise of sea levels split between living in floating cities or underground bunkers built in great heights where they mistakenly believed, the water wouldn't reach them.\n\nWhile the bunkers were eventually flooded, we are uncertain what happened to the ocean folk."

 # Stage 4

 mem_orila_primitives_pebbles_site.4.desc:0 "Back at one of the floating cities our scientists reexamined the sculptures after a slight mishap which led to one of them shattering. To their astonishment it was not made up of homogenous metallic material as the patina-like outer layer had suggested. Instead the interior had clearly separated areas of different minerals in a combination highly unlikely to be the result of natural geological processes.\n\nThe harrowing conclusion solved the mystery of the missing inhabitants. They had not vanished. They were here all along - mistaken for statues. These lithoids apparently suffered from a slow external corrosion due to the heightened humidity, slowly suffocating them. Ultimately, their attempts to save themselves from the water just postponed the inevitable.\n\nGiven their demise it can be assumed that they evolved in a much drier climate, supporting our earlier calculations regarding the planet's past. It is yet unclear, however, what led to the release of energy via the super geysir as well as various other outlets, which have been located in the meantime scattered across the ocean floor. We have started investigating these "hot spots" using underwater probes."

 # Stage 5

 mem_orila_primitives_pebbles_site.5.desc:0 "Upon reaching the underwater surface near the "hot spots" our drones began taking sediment samples as well as conducting exploratory drillings. It came as a shock, when all drillings came to a halt approximately at the same depth. After several dozen meters of dirt and debris the drills all hit a solid layer, stronger than any material we are able to manifacture, let alone anything existing naturally.\n\nUpon further exploration and various deep survey scans our data suggests this surface to stretch around the entire globe, forming a base layer on which the upper layer - earth, rock, mountains and oceans all the same - rests. To assume its origin being the result of natural processes is out of the question. The technology necessary to create such a construction easily surpasses our own, which obviously rules out the natives as its creators.\n\nThere is only one place which may offer any further avenue of exploration. The source of the super geysir itself. A specially outfitted drone will be required in order withstand the forces at work down there."

 mem_orila_primitives_pebbles_site.6.desc:0 "As it approached the source of the super geysir our drone had to fight an increasingly strong and violent current. Only thanks to its improved propulsion and shielding did it reach the large fissure in the ground from which the geysir originates.\n\nAs we had already assumed, the opening led down to the artificial construct and into an opening through its material. The drone followed the tunnel for several kilometers straight down, leaving no doubt whether or not this passage was an intended feature of the construct. During the descent the surrounding water had been replaced by superheated plasma - not magma as would have been expected. When it left the other side of the tunnel, the drone was barely functional anymore, yet we still received a last burst of telemetry before losing contact for good.\n\nAccording to the received data, the sperical construct surrounds a tiny star like a miniature dyson sphere. Our scientists assume that the star is used to provide energy that would otherwise be emitted by a planet's active core, while using less material. [From.Planet.GetName] is a massive construction to create an artificial planet. For what purpose, when there are so many simpler alternatives like habitats available, remains a mystery.\n\nHowever, the gathered data might just be, what we needed for a breakthrough."
