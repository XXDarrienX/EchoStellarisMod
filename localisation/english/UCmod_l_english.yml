 UCmod_precursor.1.desc: "During a survey of the [From.GetPlanetMoon] [From.GetName] our scanners picked up a geological signature inconsistent with the rest of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]'s composition. [Root.Leader.GetName] believes it to be an artifical structure, buried beneath the ice, and has proposed a project to excavate it."

 volgan_digsite_1: "Unknown Structure"
 volgan_digsite_1_desc: "A strange structure that looks like an ancient laboratory has been discovered below the ice."

 UCmod_precursor.2.name: "Ancient Laboratory"
 UCmod_precursor.2.desc: "After drilling down into the icy mantle of [From.Planet.GetName], our suspicions turned out to be true. The structure appears to be some sort of laboratory, based on the strange equipment found inside."
 UCmod_precursor.2.a: "Keep me informed"

 UCmod_precursor.3.name: "Cryogenic Studies"
 UCmod_precursor.3.desc: "After extracting all of the data that could be salvaged from the terminals, the purpose of the laboratory has been revealed. All of the equipment was found to be advanced Cryogenic devices and temperature measurers - The terminals still hold test logs from various experiments that was performed by whoever made it.\n\nAdditionally a subspace transmitter was found, which was configured to send the acquired data to a nearby system."
 UCmod_precursor.3.a: "Excellent"

 UCmod_precursor.4.name: "Circle In The Ice"
 UCmod_precursor.4.desc: "While searching for the destination of the data transmissions, the crew of the [Root.GetName] noticed a strange formation in the ice.\n\nInstead of the rugged landscape and uneven surface, a gigantic circle with a surprisingly flat surface covering a large portion of the [FromFrom.GetPlanetMoon] was found at the most likely location of the data reciever.\n\n[Root.Leader.GetName] believes this ice-lake was made artificially and urges us to drill down through it to see what hides at the bottom."
 UCmod_precursor.4.a: "Intriguing"

 volgan_digsite_2: "Circle In The Ice"
 volgan_digsite_2_desc: "This frozen lake does not appear to be a natural formation."

 UCmod_precursor.5.name: "Secret Entrance"
 UCmod_precursor.5.desc: "After drilling through the frozen lake, the excavation team found shaft carved from the ice with a ladder leading further down.\n\nAt the end of this shaft is a heavy-duty door made out of a material similar to what we use to construct the armor for our ships.\n\nIt will take a long time for [Root.Leader.GetName] and [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] crew to open the door, as too much heat carries the risk of collapsing the shaft."
 UCmod_precursor.5.a: "Great"

 UCmod_precursor.6.name: "Central Laboratory"
 UCmod_precursor.6.desc: "After breaching the door, we have gained access to what can only be described as a gigantic research facility. We have begun analyzing the findings, but it may take some time as the extreme temperatures of the lab make short shifts a necessity."
 UCmod_precursor.6.a: "Hurry up!"

 UCmod_precursor.7.name: "Cold Trail"
 UCmod_precursor.7.desc: "After much searching we have located a databank with information about a cryogenic project and the people behind it. They called themselves the §HVolgan§!, and according to the recovered data their time of activity was around 4 million years ago.\n\nThe reason for their disappearance is still unclear, as is their reason for constructing the cryogenic labs."
 UCmod_precursor.7.a: "Keep me informed"

 UCmod_precursor.8.name: "Project: Frozen World"
 UCmod_precursor.8.desc: "After much work our [Root.Owner.GetResearchers] have managed to clear up the last remaining files in the laboratory database. The most important appears to be one describing its key mission, a project called 'Project: Frozen World'. However, from what we can tell, most of the research was not conducted on this [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], and was instead outsourced to many smaller research outposts."
 UCmod_precursor.8.a: "We need more information on that project!"

 UCmod_precursor.9.name: "Outpost Identified"
 UCmod_precursor.9.desc: "With help from the massive amount of documentation in the database, we have deduced the most likely location of one of the Volgans research outposts."
 UCmod_precursor.9.a: "Good work"
 
 UCmod_precursor.10.name: "Strange Structure"
 UCmod_precursor.10.desc: "An unusual structure has been discovered in [From.GetName]'s lower atmosphere. In fact, it appears to be located close to what appears to be a solid core, made up of heavy elements usually found only in terrestial planets."
 UCmod_precursor.10.a: "How Strange"

 volgan_digsite_3: "A Quiet Place"
 volgan_digsite_3_desc: "A strange structure orbits the solid core of [From.Planet.GetName]. Scans show it is intact, though its finer instruments are not likely to have survived."

 UCmod_precursor.11.name: "Transmission Antenna"
 UCmod_precursor.11.desc: "After having gained access to the structure by utilizing remotely-controlled drones capable of withstanding the enourmous pressure of [From.Planet.GetName]'s atmosphere, [Root.Leader.GetName] can confidently say that this was a transmission and encryption station that stopped working approximately 4 million years ago.\n\nAfter its internal power core ran out of fuel, it switched to an emergency standby mode, becoming a repeater of any signals it recieved.\n\nWe can exploit this to our advantage. By providing it with only enough power to enter its emergency state, we can relay a signal through it, which should be directed towards one of the Volgans ancient facilities."
 UCmod_precursor.11.a: "Let's hope this is the last stage"

 UCmod_precursor.12.name: "Following The Trail"
 UCmod_precursor.12.desc: "Powering up the ancient station and using it to send a subspace signal to the nearest Volgan facility proved to be easier said than done. Because of the age of the equipment, most of it had to be replaced, and replacement parts had to be special-tailored to be operateable in the harsh environment.\n\nOur perseverance, however, paid off, and we now have the exact location of our next target!"
 UCmod_precursor.12.a: "Finally"
 
 UCmod_precursor.13.name: "Hiding In Plain Sight"
 UCmod_precursor.13.desc: "As soon as the [Root.GetName] descended through the cover of clouds, a gigantic complex became visible. With that part out of the way all we need to do is enter and figure out what happened."
 UCmod_precursor.13.a:  "Get Down And Collect That Data!"

 volgan_digsite_4: "The "Frozen World" Laboratory"
 volgan_digsite_4_desc: "The laboratory is located near a volcano. Landing near it has proven impossible, and any expeditions will have to travel a long way from a designated safe spot."

 UCmod_precursor.14.name: "The Entrance"
 UCmod_precursor.14.desc: "Upon reaching the laboratory, the crew of the [Root.GetName] found themselves in front of a huge, beautifully crafted structure, which bears a striking resemblance to the Volgans other ruins, albeit in a much better shape."
 UCmod_precursor.14.a:  "Interresting"

 UCmod_precursor.15.name: "Energy Problems"
 UCmod_precursor.15.desc: "After entering the complex, [Root.Leader.GetName] and [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] team found themselves in what appears to be the reception area of the complex, complete with a visitors section and a map of the entire structure. The most interresting part is a laboratory on the top level which is designated as Project: Frozen World's main center of research.\n However, the lifts have long since stopped working."
 UCmod_precursor.15.a: "Good idea"

 UCmod_precursor.16.name: "One Thousand and One Projects"
 UCmod_precursor.16.desc: "Despite the age of the facility, the lifts appeared to be in perfect condition. Following this, [Root.Leader.GetName] decided to supply it with power using thermal energy derived from the nearby volcano. With power restored, the lifts were then used, and the excavation team has reached the penultimate level.\n\nThanks to the reactivation of the power, many lights and doors opened automatically and has started working again, and an almost infinite number of laboratories, test zones and databases were reactivated. Despite the overwhelming number of researchers that must have been staffed here, they were all dedicated to the same project: total glaciation of a zone using cryogenic technology."
 UCmod_precursor.16.a: "Fantastic!"

 UCmod_precursor.17.name: "The Last Level"
 UCmod_precursor.17.desc: "With the laboratories throughoutly searched, the crew of the [Root.GetName] decided to go through to the last level, where they found ourselves in front of an area embedded deep into the side of the volcano, extending all the way to its magma chamber.\n\nIt appears to be partially frozen, and shows signs of melting; it is likely that the icy part was much larger before.\nHopefully the heat from the magma won't have spread too far and damaged any of the Volgans findings."
 UCmod_precursor.17.a: "Hurry up then!"

 UCmod_precursor.18.name: "The Vault"
 UCmod_precursor.18.desc: "Inside the last level, reserved for the top researchers of the Volgan Imperium is what can only be described as a bunker door. It seems that most of the energy harvested from the vulcano was channelled to the other side of this door."
 UCmod_precursor.18.a: "Open the door carefully"

 UCmod_precursor.19.name: "Almost at the end of the line"
 UCmod_precursor.19.desc: "Behind the door was an unexpected and disturbing surprise. Old uniforms and strange dust cover the floor, and more unnervingly, the dust has been confirmed to be organic in nature. Whatever catastrophy took place, it claimed many lives.\n\nMore importantly, though, was that a document was found lying on a table, still in pristine condition, which states that the culmination of Project: Frozen World, nicknamed §HThe Frozen Engine§! has been completed, and has been shipped to their capital.\n\nThe rest of the document contains words of farewell, dedicated to various people whom we can only assume to have been significant to those who met their demise here."
 UCmod_precursor.19.a: "Find it!"

 UCmod_precursor.21.name: "Volgan Home System Located"
 UCmod_precursor.21.desc: "With the information salvaged from [event_target:volgan_labworld.GetName], we have been able to find the exact galactic coordinates to §YTelaria§!, the Volgan Imperium's capital system, and the place that the §YFrozen Engine§! was sent to. We should launch an expedition to this system before someone else beats us to it"

 UCmod_precursor.21.a.tooltip: "§YTelaria System§! discovered"

 volgan_digsite_5: "A Red Graveyard"
 volgan_digsite_5_desc: "The team is approaching [From.Planet.GetName], the home planet of the §HVolgan§!. It most likely was a thriving planet at one point, but now it's just a wasteland, and according to what we know, where the Volgan's took the §YFrozen Engine§!."

 UCmod_precursor.22.name: "Domed Cities"
 UCmod_precursor.22.desc: "The crew of the [Root.GetName] has discovered several Destroyed Cities encased in huge domes. The cities are at unbearably low temperatures, making difficult to explore them. It will take a while to work out where the §HFrozen Engine§! has been taken."
 UCmod_precursor.22.a: "Be careful"

 UCmod_precursor.23.name: "The Capital"
 UCmod_precursor.23.desc: "We found a city completely surrounded by a dome much more sophisticated than the rest. The interior has an even lower temperature than the other cities. Despite this, the crew is eager to continue exploring the home of the ancient Volgans."
 UCmod_precursor.23.a: "Keep me informed"

 UCmod_precursor.24.name: "The Town Hall"
 UCmod_precursor.24.desc: "After reaching the center of the city, a startling discovery was made: Thousands of corpses, piled up against the central building. They appeared to have died of heat strokes, and many of them are completely naked, apparently having shed their clothes in a last attempt at keeping themselves at an acceptable temperature."
 UCmod_precursor.24.a: "What a disturbing find"

 UCmod_precursor.25.name: "The Regrowth Laboratory"
 UCmod_precursor.25.desc: "Inside the central building, the temperature is even lower, reaching almost absolute zero. Furthermore, the excavation team has found a cloning facility in which ten cylinders supposedly contained ten embryos; records found nearby say that these embryos was to be used for a 'Growth Cycle' when the planet's temperature reached the correct temperature.\nExploration continues."
 UCmod_precursor.25.a: "Strange"

 UCmod_precursor.26.name: "Lost hope"
 UCmod_precursor.26.desc: "Exploring deeper into the centre, the excavation team has found more corpses, this time all of which appears to wear clothes consistent with the clothes found on [event_target:volgan_labworld.GetName]. Nearby was a sealed black box nearby."
 UCmod_precursor.26.a: "Bring it to safety and open it"

 UCmod_precursor.27.name: "The Black Box"
 UCmod_precursor.27.desc: "Inside the box we finally found what we were looking for, along with a note with the necessary information on how to use it.\n The '§YFrozen Engine§!' is a tool used to terraform a planet, utilizing vacum-power to extract energy from the movements in atoms, slowing them down and effectively turning the planet into a Frozen World.\nFrom what we can gather, [From.Planet.GetName] was not always this temperature, and was in fact much lower.\n\nThe [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] appears to have once been a frozen world, and the Volgans had evolved to live in extreme cold. Even small increases in temperature could drive them to extinction.\n\nWhen the planet began warming due to centuries of Volgan Industrial activity, they created this object to save their home planet but failed to do so in time."
 UCmod_precursor.27.a: "We have obtained a powerful tool"
