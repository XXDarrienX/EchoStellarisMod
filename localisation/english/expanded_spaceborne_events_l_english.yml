leviathans.321.desc.e:0 "We have finally gotten the unpleasant odors out of the furniture, which has freed our artists to pursue more creative endeavors. No use trying to paint when the room smells like rotting fish, after all.\n\nOne of our members have been surprisingly inspired by the smell, however, and has been hard on work on a secretive project. We don't quite know what it is yet, but donate today, and we guarantee you will be the first to find out!"
leviathans.321.desc.f:0 "Sadly, there was a tragic accident at the Enclave this month. One of our kinetic sculptures in progress suddenly malfunctioned, dropping several hundred kilos of alloys on the unsuspecting workers below. They are currently resting in our hospital wing, and are thankfully expected to make a full recovery.\n\nAny donations that might help the injured in this trying time would be of tremendous help. We thank you for your continued support!"
leviathans.321.desc.g:0 "Our secretive artist has finally come out of their seclusion. Inspired by some of the strange chemicals used in our failed scent-centered media project, she engineered a whole new range of color-changing pigments that react to the moods of those around it! While it currently only works with the unique pheromones of our own species, we are confident that, with some modifications, we can make it work with any of the varied species of the Galaxy.\n\nThis advancement could not have been made without the donations of patrons like you. If you are feeling generous, please don't hesitate to give."

spacecreatures.3.name:1 "Pirates Encountered"
spacecreatures.3.desc: "We have sighted hostile ships in the [From.Solar_System.GetName] System! They are not responding to hails, and their designs are obviously not of [Root.GetSpeciesName] origin. It seems like they are mostly focused on looting our orbital stations, stripping them of valuable resources and technology while taking their crews captive."

spacecreatures.13.name:0 "Crystals Repacified"
spacecreatures.13.desc:0 "With the destruction of the crystalline construct in the [FromFrom.solar_system.GetName] system, the remaining Crystalline Entities have ceased hostilities. Without an overriding signal to control them, they have reverted back to their previously-observed behaviors."
spacecreatures.14.name:0 "Crystal Nidus"
spacecreatures.14.desc:0 "Now that we have control over the [Root.Solar_System.GetName] System, we can get a closer look at the local crystalline construct. Scans taken from the nearby outpost confirmed previous speculation that the crystal construct is in fact a Crystalline Entity, but much larger.\n\nOur scientists are eager to study this creature further, but some caution that the invasive nature of the research might trigger a threat response."
spacecreatures.14.a:0 "Send a science ship to perform the research"
spacecreatures.14.b:0 "It would be safer to leave it alone."
spacecreatures_15_pre:0 "The massive Crystalline Entity is far older than the others - indeed, it may be the source of the other crystals. During observation, we observed several Crystalline Entities budding off of the larger crystal as part of its inexplicable continual growth. For perhaps this reason, it appears to be at the top of the crystal's social hierarchy. The crystals resonant waveforms, now believed to be commands, have a drastic effect on the other crystal's behavior."
spacecreatures.15.desc:0 "$spacecreatures_15_pre$\n\nWe were also able to obtain a sample of its hard crystal exterior. The material proved hardier than expected, capable of withstanding significant force during testing. We should be able to emulate the reconstructive properties of the crystal matrix for use in our own ships."
spacecreatures.16.desc:0 "$spacecreatures_15_pre$\n\nUnfortunately, while trying to obtain a sample of its crystalline exterior, the entity apparently took exception to our probing and turned hostile, commanding its subservient crystals to come to its aid."
spacecreatures.17.name:0 "Void Cloud Pacified"
spacecreatures.17.desc:0 "The Void Clouds appear to be quite chatty, frequently communicating through their quantum impulses, although we can only guess what they're saying to each other. Through significant adjustments to our communication array we can closely imitate their signals.\n\nSurprisingly, the Void Clouds proved to be more sophisticated than expected, able to distinguish meaningful messages from random noise. Through trial and error we were able to guess at several signals that will allow our ships to pass through their space unmolested. Many unmanned probes were destroyed to bring us this information."
spacecreatures.17.desc.spir:0 "Through careful observation and dedicated meditation, we have begun to decipher the Void Cloud's quantum energies. By modifying our communication arrays, we can speak the very language of the stars themselves!\n\nBut being able to speak is not enough - one must know the correct words. These venerable guardians deserve to be shown respect, but how does one show deference to such luminous beings? Only after many trials - and many destroyed test probes - did we learn how to show proper obeisance."
spacecreatures.17.a.tooltip:0 "§Y$pacified_clouds$§! modifier added, giving the following effects:\n§HVoid Cloud§! fleets are rendered §Gnon-hostile§!"
story.305.c:0 "Perhaps we can reprogram them"
spacecreatures.18.name:0 "Mining Drones Reprogrammed"
spacecreatures.18.desc:0 "Through mimicking the drone's signal pings, we were able to open up an back door and gain access to their root directory. From here it was trivially easy to reprogram the drones to ignore the presence of our ships.\n\nSurprised at how effective their hack had been, our researched tried to go one step farther and take control over the drones themselves. Unfortunately, after commandeering only a small number of ships, the drone network finally noticed our intrusion and kicked us out, patching up the exploits we used in the process."
spacecreatures.18.a.tooltip:0 "Up to two new mineral deposits will be discovered in the [new_drone_system.GetName] system.\n\n§Y$pacified_drones$§! modifier added, giving the following effects:\n§HMining Drones§! fleets are rendered §Gnon-hostile§!"
spacecreatures.19.name:0 "The Ore Grinder"
spacecreatures.19.desc:0 "The mineral processing hub in the [drone_home_base_system.GetName] System is believed to hold thousands of years of uncollected minerals and strategic metals, ripe for the taking. Unfortunately, even though the drones have been reprogrammed not to attack our ships, this courtesy does not appear to hold near the central processing facility. Anything that gets too close besides another drone is ruthlessly shot down. We will need to find another way past the drones if we wish to lay claim to their mineral bounty."
spacecreatures.19.a:0 "Try to spoof our way past"
spacecreatures.19.b:0 "Try the direct approach"
spacecreatures.19.b.tooltip:0 "§RMining Drones will become aggressive again§!"
spacecreatures.20.desc:0 "By spoofing their signal pings, we were able to fool the drone network into thinking our ships were drones making mineral deliveries. The system didn't seem to notice that we were loading minerals onto our ships instead of the other way around, allowing us to recover most of its stores of processed minerals and precious alloys."

spacecreatures.30.1.desc:0 "The Galactic Emperor would make a fine challenge for our warriors. Perhaps a visit is in order..."
spacecreatures.30.2.desc:0 "Yes, dwamak chiefs would make for the best dwamak-stew. Very good. But it is much effort..."
spacecreatures.30.3.desc:0 "She of the Void does not look kindly on the arrogant [preliminary_target.GetSpeciesNamePlural] who dare proclaim themselves rulers of the galaxy. A military expedition might serve Her will..."

spaceleviathans.1.desc:0 "We will trade Alloys and Consumer Goods for a monthly bill of Energy Credits, plus a small upfront fee. These are our current deals."

spaceleviathans.1.b.reply:0 "An excellent choice. You will not be disappointed by the quality of our products."
spaceleviathans.3.desc:0 "Dearest customer, we regret to inform you that the trade deal we negotiated for the export of manufactured goods to the worlds of the [Root.GetName] has run its course. We are of course more than willing to extend the deal for another ten years if you have the energy credits to spare..."
spaceleviathans.6.desc:0 "We have reached the end of our agreement, [Root.GetSpeciesName]. We have shipped manufactured goods to your worlds for ten years. Should we continue for another ten, or do you wish to end this arrangement?"
spaceleviathans.9.desc:0 "The years just fly by, don't they, [Root.GetSpeciesName]? It has now been ten years since we arranged our trade deal for manufactured goods. Do you wish to extend the deal for another decade?"
spaceleviathans.3.b:0 "We can do without your goods for now"

spaceleviathans.10.desc:0 "It is certainly possible! While most of our customer only value our products for their use as exotic gases, it was always intended to ease the often difficult process of adapting to a foreign planetary environment. Equipped with our patented XuraGel, colonists could thrive on worlds even when their climates are particularly unforgiving!\n\nUnfortunately, each species requires their own unique alterations to the XuraGel formula in order for it to be safe to use. We can make these alteration for you, of course, but they will cost you dearly. Fortunately we already have a complete map of the genomes of all the species in your empire, so the process will not take very long. You can thank us later."
spaceleviathans.10.a:0 "We accept your offer. (§Y5000 £energy£§!)"
spaceleviathans.10.a.tooltip:0 "Gain access to the XuraGel Edict, which gives: §G+10%§! Habitability"
spaceleviathans.10.a.reply:0 "Very good! Once our researchers have finished modifying the formula, you can employ XuraGel on your worlds. In order to use it safely, you must use the special XuraCorp-brand exotic gases. Gases from elsewhere have far too many impurities."
leviathans.103.pop.a:0 "We are interested in Riggan Spice."
spaceleviathans.11.desc:0 "While Volatile Motes are most known for their explosive properties, our unique blend of motes can be made into Riggan Spice, which is not only delicious, but heightens the reflexes. Few outside the Riggan Commerce Exchange know how to make Riggan Spice safely, but because the [Root.GetName] is such a valued customer, we would be willing to lend you access to a team of our artisans, specially trained in the production of Spice."
spaceleviathans.11.a.tooltip:0 "Gain access to the Riggan Spice Edict, which gives: §G+5%§! Fire Rate and §G+10%§! Army Damage"
spaceleviathans.11.a.reply:0 "Excellent! We will send you our artisans right away. They will require our own special blend of motes, however, so you will only be able to make use of their services if you are actively trading with us."
leviathans.104.pop.a:0 "We are interested in Muutagan Crystals"
spaceleviathans.12.desc:0 "The Shi'rakkat-Du! You use them in your buildings, your luxuries, your lasers, yet they will not sing for you like they sing for Muutagan. It takes a special touch to coax the Shi'rakkat-Du to sing its soothing tones. We only share this knowledge with our most trusted customers. For a nominal fee, we will teach you how to make our crystals sing!"
spaceleviathans.12.a.tooltip:0 "Gain access to the Muutagan Crystal Edict, which gives: §G+5%§! Stability and §G+5%§! Happiness"
spaceleviathans.12.a.reply:0 "You have chosen wisely! May the Shi'rakkat-Du sing only the most pleasing tones!\n\nWe must strongly recommend that you only use crystals from the Muutagan Merchant Guild. Crystals from elsewhere are... discordant."

spaceleviathans.13.desc:0 "For our dear valued customer, perhaps. Sometimes small amounts of valuable goods pass through our hands. Dark Matter. Zro. Living Metal. And sometimes, something more... exotic. For our most trusted customers, many things are possible."
spaceleviathans.13.a.reply:0 "Thank you for your patronage. Your requested items will be delivered to your space shortly."
spaceleviathans.13.blackmail:0 "A collated collection of blackmail and political intrigue."

spaceleviathans.102.desc.xenophile:0 "$spaceleviathans_102_predescription$Their showcase of artwork from across the galaxy was an immediate sensation, with tickets sold out in a matter of hours. The local government is already in discussions with the troupe to make the installation a permanent exhibition."
spaceleviathans.102.desc.xenophobe:0 "$spaceleviathans_102_predescription$Their showcase was met with mixed reception by the local population. While the selection of [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] artists were widely praised, the inclusion of alien artwork was significantly more controversial.

spaceleviathans.102.desc.spiritualist:0 "$spaceleviathans_102_predescription$While a small minority of local priests have denounced the fusion of [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] spiritual traditions with alien artistry as heretical, the exhibition was generally well received.

spaceleviathans.102.desc.materialist:0 "$spaceleviathans_102_predescription$Their exhibit was dedicated to showcasing the technical accomplishments of the [Root.GetName].

spaceleviathans.102.desc.egalitarian:0 "$spaceleviathans_102_predescription$Dedicated to the eternal struggle for liberty across the galaxy, their exhibition proved extremely popular, and perhaps more than a little enlightening.

spaceleviathans.102.desc.music:0 "$spaceleviathans_102_predescription$The resulting performance of music from across the galaxy proved an instant success, becoming so popular that the Artisan Troupe extended their tour dates.

spaceleviathans.121.desc:0 "$spaceleviathans_newletter_opener$A sad time for the art world, dear reader. The legendary artist Oaxur Halna has died peaceful in his sleep this month at the venerable age of 169. Most well known for pioneering the Hypercubic Impressionism movement, throughout his long and storied career he worked to raise the art world to new heights. Even on his death bed, Oaxur strived to push the boundaries of the art to new frontiers. Sadly, his last work of Hyper-Sensory Post-Nouveau Surrealism will never be completed.\n\nOaxur's children have graciously established a charitable organization to fund the works of ambitious artists, in memory of their father's legacy. They are currently accepting donations from all interested parties."
spaceleviathans.122.desc:0 "$spaceleviathans_newletter_opener$Sadly nothing much has been produced in the enclave.
