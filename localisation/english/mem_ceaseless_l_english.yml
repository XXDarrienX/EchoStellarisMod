 origin_mem_ceaseless_gaze: "Ceaseless Gaze"
 origin_mem_ceaseless_gaze_desc: "In the distant past this civilization was able to launch a multitude of surveyor probes which would monitor the development of the universe. A disaster wiped out their old civilization and its spacefaring capabilities, and now they are ready to reach out to stars once again."
 origin_tooltip_mem_ceaseless_gaze: "Start with a §YRelic World§! as your homeworld. \nA §SSurveyor Probe§! is guaranteed to spawn somewhere in the galaxy. Although it does not recognize you as its masters, you will have contact with it."
 START_SCREEN_MEM_CEASELESS_GAZE: "Our distant ancestors, although more than capable of space travel, chose against leaving our world. Instead, they built a series of sophisticated probes capable of spotting and neutralizing alien threats and sent them into the unknown. Their first great discovery was a fascinating system bordering our own, housing an anomalous and unstable wormhole connecting it to a multitude of systems.\n\nUsing this wormhole, their probes quickly spread into the far reaches of our galaxy. In their belief that adequate galactic surveillance would keep them safe, they became complacent, unaware of the truly alien dangers lurking out there. Their end must have come fast and unexpected, as there is no documentation of the events that let to the cataclysm which destroyed their civilization. Whether it was an internal or external threat remains a mystery to us.\n\nIn the centuries it took us to rebuild, "Ceaseless Gaze"-class probes have travelled far across the galaxy. Over time, likely most of them either broke down or were destroyed. Today, only one continues to send its regular location updates. Not long ago it returned to [Capital_Scope.GetName], filing reports we were unable to decipher and requesting new orders from its dead creators. Although we have tried to reason with its AI many times, it did not recognize us as the legitimate successors to the Alkree Imperium that once had built it.\n\nNow we are once again able to leave the confines of our ancestral home. We intend not to make the same mistakes as the Imperium of old."
