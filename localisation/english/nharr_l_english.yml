 EMPIRE_DESIGN_nharr_desc:0 "As a primitive people Nharrs reached out across the horizons of their home planet. Their ancestors have traded across the great oceans as far back as the written word.\n\nThe early traders carried thousands of different superstitions and spiritual beliefs across Lyrass, but over time those fractured beliefs fell before an increasing refinement in measurements of the natural world.\n\nNow Nharrs reach out across the void into a vast galaxy filled with modern day spirits and gods to unmask, new peoples to meet, and new worlds on which to steer for the horizon."
