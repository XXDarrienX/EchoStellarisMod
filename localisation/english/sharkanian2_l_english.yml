 EMPIRE_DESIGN_sharkanian1_desc: "A violent and voracious species, sharkanians have evolved as amphibious creatures, even though they prefer to still live underwater. Their once nomadic societies have been recently reorganized into a one-world government after a devastating global conflict that nearly extinguished all life on their homeworld.\n\nThe Deep Tide is a militaristic totalitarian regime that encourages active participation from the citizens to eradicate political and cultural corruption whenever found. Its main goal is the preservation of a clean and ordered society at all costs, shaped upon a romanticized view of Carcharian primitive communities. Although this system fosters both an egalitarian drive and a meritocratic government, it also results in a low tolerance for non-comformist points of view and foreign cultures."
