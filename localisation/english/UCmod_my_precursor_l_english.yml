 volgan_gateway: "Reach Telaria"
 volgan_gateway_DESC: "We now know where the Volgan home system is, but not yet how to get there. However, our scientists have identified a spatial anomaly with a frequency that matches the signature of the Volgan Star. Perhaps it is some sort of hidden gateway."
 UCmod_volgan_connected: "Ancient Portal to Telaria Opens"
 UCmod_volgan_connected_desc: "Our scientists have stabilized the ancient gateway that leads to the Volgan homeworld. Travelling through it is yet another matter. It appears that long ago there was a structure in space that maintained the connection, however the passing of time has left no traces of the original gateway, all that remains is an unstable wormhole."
