They are natural leaders, fierce and charismatic, but only when dealing with other, more peaceful species. \n \n Once divided in many tribes, they have slowly coalesced into a single Empire after generations of tighter and tighter trade agreements between their former Nation-States. Their society is based on discipline and competition, rewarding excellence with socio-political advancement. \n \n Aquilesi are ready to brave the unknown depths of space, discover new species and conquer them for the glory of the Empire."
