 EMPIRE_DESIGN_romaneagles1_desc:0 "Aquilesi are prideful and shrewd people, evolved from an avian species of solitary predators from Enchiria. They are natural leaders, fierce and charismatic, but only when dealing with other, more peaceful species. \n \n Once divided in many tribes, they have slowly coalesced into a single Empire after generations of tighter and tighter trade agreements between their former Nation-States. Their society is based on discipline and competition, rewarding excellence with socio-political advancement. \n \n Aquilesi are ready to brave the unknown depths of space, discover new species and conquer them for the glory of the Empire."
