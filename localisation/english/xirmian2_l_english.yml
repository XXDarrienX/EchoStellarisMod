 EMPIRE_DESIGN_xirmian1_desc: "Xirmians are obnoxious socialites endowed with bright, chaotic minds. They evolved on a temperate world as a vegetarian species, their diet being made up of mostly sugary fruit.\n\nThey are short humanoids with a weak frame and a youthful appearance, fond of recoloring and modifying their own body to meet their aesthetic needs.\n\nHaving unified their conglomerate Nations through social media, they quickly moved to the stars, already set on welcoming and integrating new friendly species within their Astral Concordate.\n\nWhile not outright Pacifists, Xirmians use diplomacy and political maneuvering as their main weapons, taking a pragmatic and moderate approach to the interplanetary power games, forging strong alliances while isolating and surgically removing those they cannot reason with."
