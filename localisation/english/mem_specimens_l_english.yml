 mem_crawler_statue_desc_details: "This apparently ancient stone statue bears remarkable similarities to our little guest. From its overall shape to the number of appendages and the structure of its mandibles the statue is an almost eerily close depiction. In fact some had thought it to be a real specimen repainted and glued to a base plate, but a scan confirmed it to be made of a single piece of solid rock. Whatever so-called cultist created it, they must have been a master of their art. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that other civilizations have had encounters with specimens of the crawler species in the past. Why it has been painted in such a negative light, however, is up for debate as we have never observed any aggressive tendencies from our actually quite docile guest so far."
