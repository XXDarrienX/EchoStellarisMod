START_SCREEN_AMOEBA:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape on [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization has spread and prospered.\n\nYet unbeknownst to our ancestors, we shared our home system with interstellar visitors. For hundreds of years we knew them only as faint dots in our telescopes, distinguishable from the planets only by their eratic movement. It was not until the space age that we discovered the true nature of these so-called Space Amoebas: they were spaceborn aliens, making their nests among the planets of our outer solar system. While distrustful at first, with time and effort we have learned to coexist in peace.\n\nNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. What new wonders are out there, waiting to be discovered?"
