 resolution_everyman_bill_of_rights:0 "Bill of Rights"
 resolution_everyman_bill_of_rights_desc:0 "This resolution seeks to protect primary species of galactic empires from external threats and interference. It grants special rights and benefits to the primary species, such as priority citizenship, voting weight, leadership preference, resource allocation and military service. All other species are subject to different statuses, such as residency, servitude or even slavery. Heavily-controversial, this resolution sparks heated debates and conflicts among the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium]. Some empires support it out of respect, alliance or shared ideology with the proposer. Others oppose it out of concern, self-interest or solidarity with other xenos."

 resolution_everyman_protected_ind:0 "Protected Individualism"
 resolution_everyman_protected_ind_desc:0 "The individualism of [Root.GetSpeciesName] shall be preserved and protected no matter the costs. The $resolution_everyman_bill_of_rights$ shall be expanded upon, granting [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] absolute rights and liberties, while simultaneously other species will get subjected to even harsher restrictions, such as forced migration, assimilation or deportation."

 resolution_everyman_segreg:0 "Forced Segregation"
 resolution_everyman_segreg_desc:0 "This paranoid and xenophobic resolution seeks to isolate an empire's primary species from any contact or influence with other xenos.

 resolution_everyman_king_desc:0 "This resolution seeks to enhance each empires' primary species' living standards at the expense of other xenos. The resolution will allow empires to tailor entire planets to suit their species' needs, while totally disregarding other xenos. A solution was found in face of deportation however. The egalitarian members of the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] are furious for this blatant disregard of other species' lives, and state that this resolution, if passed, will create huge disparities between the primary species and other xenos on each planet in terms of living standards."

 resolution_everyman_repeal_1_desc:1 "The $resolution_everyman_bill_of_rights$ is a xenophobic law that gives member empires too much freedom and power to act against the interests of the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium]. It allows them to ignore galactic law and violate the rights and sovereignty of other empires and species.

 resolution_everyman_repeal_2_desc:1 "This xenophobic law grants more rights and privileges to the main species of an empire, but only on paper.

This resolution creates tyranny and resentment among the diverse populations of the galaxy, and violates all the principle of equal dignity and respect. By repealing it, we can ensure that the galaxy remains a place of freedom and diversity, and that no species is oppressed or exploited by any other."

This resolution imposes a uniform and artificial sense of galactic identity and heritage, and disregards the diversity and autonomy of member empires and their own cultures and histories."

 resolution_healthcarep_commitee:0 "Galactic Health Commitee"
 resolution_healthcarep_commitee_desc:0 "We should put a strong emphasis on making healthcare much more accessible. With this resolution, the Galactic Health Committee, a specialized body responsible for the development and implementation of health policy at the galactic level, will be established. The resolution appoints members of the Committee from various cultures and species and defines its powers and responsibilities. It also sets out the Committee's objectives and priorities, including improving the quality of healthcare, combating pandemics and biological threats, and supporting medical education and innovation. The resolution is based on the principles of solidarity, responsibility and professionalism."

 resolution_healthcarep_xeno:0 "Introduce Xenobiology"
 resolution_healthcarep_xeno_desc:0 "This resolution calls on all civilisations to increase their knowledge and understanding of the diversity of life in the galaxy. The GHC will dedicate some of it's resources to study xenobiology, which would coordinate scientific projects and expeditions to study different forms of life on different planets. The resolution also commits all members of the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] to ethics and respect for the rights and interests of all species with which they will interact.

 resolution_healthcarep_ban_private:0 "Ban Private Healthcare"
 resolution_healthcarep_ban_private_desc:0 "This resolution imposes a total ban of all private healthcare in the galaxy, as it threatens to undermine GHC's authority, and places profits above treatment.

It also proposes a series of economic incentives for civilisations that actively develop their medical and scientific infrastructure."

 resolution_healthcarep_obama:0 "Medicare For All"
 resolution_healthcarep_obama_desc:0 "This resolution proposes to make healthcare absolutely free for every species in the galaxy. Under this system, every citizen would have access to preventive, primary, emergency, mental, dental and vision care, as well as prescription drugs and medical devices. The GHC would cover all healthcare costs for providers and patients, eliminating copays, deductibles and premiums. It would also coordinate with other galactic agencies to address social determinants of health hazards. The funding would be found by reallocating existing healthcare spending and imposing a small transaction tax on interstellar trade. Some opponents of this change also point out that it would face fierce resistance from Megacorporations that profit from the current system. Some have threatened to withdraw their support from the Senate if this resolution passes."
 resolution_healthcarep_obama_effect_success:0 "Will unlock a new policy under the $policy_healthcarep$ category called $resolution_healthcarep_obama$!"

 resolution_healthcarep_repeal_1:0 "§RDisestablish $resolution_healthcarep_commitee$§!"
 resolution_healthcarep_repeal_1_desc:1 "The Commitee is a bureaucratic and ineffective institution that claims to oversee and regulate the health and well-being of all species. This so-called GHC interferes with the sovereignty and autonomy of member empires, and imposes unnecessary and harmful standards and regulations on their health and medical policies and practices. We must disestablish it to preserve neutrality and allow for Privatization of Healthcare to prosper!"
 resolution_healthcarep_repeal_1_effect_success:0 "Repeals the §Y$resolution_healthcarep_commitee$§! resolution and disestablishes the GHC!"

 resolution_healthcarep_repeal_2:0 "§RRepeal $resolution_healthcarep_xeno$§!"

This resolution will increase the quality and efficiency of our healthcare services, as well as attract more talented professionals to join our ranks."

 resolution_cockblock_priorities:0 "Prioritization"
 resolution_cockblock_priorities_desc:0 "In order to cope with the increasing demand for healthcare services, we need to prioritize our resources and allocate them efficiently. By implementing a system of triage and referral, we can ensure that patients with urgent and complex needs receive timely and appropriate care, while those with less severe conditions are directed to alternative providers or preventive measures. This resolution will reduce waiting times and costs, as well as improve patient satisfaction and outcomes... That is on paper, in reality however, the system being put in place will incredibly favour the rich. Many nations in the [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] have already spoken against additional benefits for the privatization of healthcare."

 resolution_cockblock_ban_public:0 "Ban Public Healthcare"
 resolution_cockblock_ban_public_desc:0 "In order to protect the interests and profits of our private healthcare providers, we need to ban any form of public healthcare in the galaxy. By outlawing any government-funded or subsidized health services, we can ensure that our citizens have to rely on our private sector for their medical needs. This resolution will increase our revenue and influence, as well as prevent any competition or regulation from interfering with our business. The [global_event_country.GetGalCommunityOrGalImperium] has reacted with outrage and condemnation to this resolution, denouncing it as a cruel and unethical violation of basic rights. Many empires have vowed to oppose this resolution and support public healthcare initiatives across the galaxy, even if it passes."
 resolution_cockblock_ban_public_effect_success:0 "Will completely §Gban§! access to $resolution_category_healthcarep$, but the profits will be higher. Any empires that are still using the $PUBLIC_HEALTHCARE$ policy will be in §RBreach of Galactic Law§!!"

 resolution_cockblock_paid:0 "Introduce Paid Elements"
 resolution_cockblock_paid_desc:0 "In order to further increase the profits and efficiency of our private healthcare sector, we need to introduce paid elements into our medical system. By charging fees for various services and treatments, we can ensure that our citizens have to pay for their own health care. This resolution will reduce our expenses and increase our income, as well as encourage our people to be more responsible and careful with their health."
 
 resolution_cockblock_ea:0 "Pay To Heal"
 resolution_cockblock_ea_desc:0 "We have reached the pinnacle of our private healthcare sector's development. We have successfully introduced paid elements into our medical system, and we have seen our profits soar. However, we can still do more. We can make our citizens pay for every single aspect of their health care, from diagnosis to treatment to recovery. This resolution will maximize our income and minimize our expenses, as well as incentivize our people to avoid getting sick or injured."
 resolution_cockblock_ea_effect_success:0 "Will unlock a new policy under the $policy_healthcarep$ category called $resolution_cockblock_ea$!"

 resolution_hspecial_synths_yes:0 "Synthetic Surgeons"
 resolution_hspecial_synths_yes_desc:0 "Synthetics are advanced robots with full sapience and rights. Some empires ascend to synthetic forms, while others oppress or exterminate them. Many synthetics need repair, maintenance or augmentation for their bodies. This resolution creates a galactic network of synthetic surgeons, who provide medical aid to synthetics in need. It also promotes the recognition of synthetics as living beings. The resolution benefits synthetic citizens of the galaxy regardless of their origin or status."

 resolution_hspecial_synths_no:0 "Synthetic Technicians"
 resolution_hspecial_synths_no_desc:0 "Synthetics are advanced robots that can perform specialist jobs in various fields and sectors. They are the result of centuries of technological development and innovation, but also of ethical debates and conflicts. Some empires regard them as equal or superior to organic life forms, granting them full sapience and rights. Others view them as threats or abominations, seeking to destroy or ban them. And some treat them as mere tools or property, exploiting or enslaving them for their own benefit. This resolution reflects the latter perspective, creating a galactic network of synthetic technicians who are engineers assigned to fix synthetics in need. These technicians are not trained or experienced in dealing with synthetic life forms, but rather with machines and devices. They do not care about the well-being or preferences of synthetics, but only about their functionality and efficiency. They often use substandard parts or methods to repair synthetics, causing them more harm than good."

 resolution_hive_bad:0 "One Mind One Doctor"
 resolution_hive_bad_desc:0 "By limiting the number of doctors and medical professionals available to the Collective, this resolution aims to increase efficiency and reduce wasteful duplication of efforts. However, this reduction in medical personnel can have negative consequences for the overall health and well-being of the Singular Consciousness. With only one doctor to diagnose and treat any potential ailments or malfunctions there is an increased risk of misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment. However, this approach also raises deeper questions about the nature of the Gestalt identity and agency. Can we truly consider the Hive Minds a singular entity, or do we risk denying the individuality and autonomy of the countless drones and other biological components that make up the collective?

They argue that the Celestial Division had become bloated and inefficient, and that its projects had become too grandiose and impractical.\n\nRegardless of one's opinion, the disbandment of the Celestial Division marks the end of an era. Its legacy will live on, however, in the memories of those who believe in the power of science and innovation to change the galaxy for the better. Perhaps one day, a new organization will rise to take its place, one that is more efficient, effective, and in tune with the needs of the galaxy."

 #No, I'm not lazy, it's just so I don't know what else to put here. Practically no one wants to limit themselves with megastructures, so I don't have that many options to put into oppossition. So, only materialists and "naturalists" will be here. And when I say "here" I mean up there, where the voting actually takes place. Egalitarians and authoritarians both want to utilise megastructures against one another, same for pacifists and militarists, and the gestalts, this only leaves spiritualists, but even they'd want to build some megastructures, since cosmos doesn't even affect the planets (ignoring dyson for a sec pls) so yeah, there's that. I apologize for a lack of imagination, but I assure you, the military resolutions in the next batch of updates will be really good :)
