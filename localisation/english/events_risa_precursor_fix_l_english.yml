 precursor.604.desc:0 "The news of discovery of Yuht homeworld just arrived from §Y[From.Owner.GetName]§!. Those bombardment craters on it look eerily familiar.

 precursor.1104.desc:0 "The news of discovery of First League's capital world just arrived from §Y[From.Owner.GetName]§!. That planet-wide city is unmistakably the same one we thought to be of a valueless minor space civilization, based on a now-proven-wrong age estimate. The investigation was assigned low priority, soon buried deep in ever-long to-do list. \n\nNow it's probably too late to grab anything valuable there."

 precursor.2104.name:0 "The Cybrex Central Nexus Discovery Overlooked"
 precursor.2104.desc:0 "The news of discovery of The Cybrex Central Nexus just arrived from §Y[From.Owner.GetName]§!. Yes, that magnificent ring world, we have been there. Our xenoarcheologist society believed it may be constructed and abandoned by some Fallen Empire, and advised against ruthless investigation. Now they are proven wrong. \n\nAlas, it's probably too late to grab anything valuable there."

 precursor.110.desc:0 "We have discovered the location of presumed Vultaum homeworld. Preliminary survey found lots of interesting items around the shattered [From.GetPlanetMoon]. We shall hurry to carry out detailed investigation on it, lest other empires come and loot it."
 precursor.111.desc.a:0 "The shattered remnants of the Vultaum homeworld reveal that it underwent a massive extinction event 12 million years ago, caused by the detonation of some kind of antimatter device. From the ruins that remain on the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface, we have learned that Vultaum society experienced a radical ideological shift a century before their extinction.\n\nTheir new philosophy posited that the entire universe was an artificial reality which all sentient beings had been unwittingly plugged into for the amusement of some higher power. The Vultaum undertook increasingly radical attempts to forcefully "disconnect" themselves from this simulation, most of which involved mass suicide.\n\nThey finally concluded that only the simultaneous disconnection of billions of individuals would destabilize the system enough to grant them freedom. At an agreed upon hour, Vultaum everywhere killed themselves by any means available. Those who refused to take part in this mass suicide were too few to repopulate the species, and so the Vultaum faded into obscurity and eventual extinction." 
 precursor.111.desc.b:0 "$precursor.111.desc.a$\n\nWith data we gathered through previous investigation of Vultaum artifacts, we managed to locate some addtional caches of Vultaum treasures as well."
 precursor.112.desc.a:0 "The shattered homeworld of the ancient Vultaum has been found, but it has clearly been visited by someone else recently. Most of surface has been looted. However, with careful analysis of data collected during previous investigation of Vultaum artifacts, we determine a hidden cache of Vultaum equipments might be left untouched."
 precursor.112.a:0 "Let's see what they missed."
 precursor.114.name:0 "Vultaum Homeworld Looted"
 precursor.114.desc.a:0 "§Y[From.Owner.GetName]§! just announced they had completed excavation of treasures from Vultaum Homeworld. Our xenoarcheologist team wasn't quick enough to recover anything valuable.\n\nNow they have to go home empty-handed."
 precursor.114.desc.b:0 "§Y[From.Owner.GetName]§! just announced they had completed excavation of treasures from Vultaum Homeworld. Our xenoarcheologist team wasn't quick enough to recover anything valuable.\n\nHowever, §Ythe [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! seemed to miss a hidden cache of Vultaum backup hardwares, whose location we deduced from data we collected during previous investigation of Vultaum artifacts."
 precursor.115.desc:0 "The hidden cache is far from plenty, but we still manage to learn from it a lot of Vultaum technology and their history. It seems the destruction of their empire was through their own hands. They went through mass suicide from some weird philosophical reasons. The few who refused to participate were not enough to repopulate. Soon extinction followed."
 precursor.610.desc:0 "We have discovered the location of presumed Yuht homeworld. Preliminary survey found lots of interesting items around the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. We shall hurry to carry out detailed investigation on it, lest other empires come and loot it."
 precursor.611.desc.a:0 "We have confirmed that §Y[From.From.GetName]§! was the original homeworld of the Yuht. The [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] suffered extensive orbital bombardment roughly four million years ago. Twisted metal skeletons are all that remain of the massive arcologies that once covered the surface.\n\nFrom what we can piece together, it seems the Yuht spent the better part of a million years searching local space in vain for signs of intelligent alien life. When they finally encountered the Jabbardeeni, a young race that had only recently achieved interstellar travel, their alien psychology was a tremendous shock.\n\nThe Yuht leadership reached a consensus: the Jabbardeeni had to be eradicated before they grew too powerful. A massive surprise attack was launched, which was beaten back at great cost for both sides. Despite their young age, the Jabbardeeni were already experimenting with technologies the Yuht had never considered, and eventually they gained the upper hand. After less than a decade of warfare, the two million year old Yuht Empire was utterly destroyed."
 precursor.611.desc.b:0 "$precursor.611.desc.a$\n\nWith data we gathered through previous investigation of Yuht artifacts, we managed to locate some addtional caches of Yuht supply as well."
 precursor.612.desc.a:0 "We have discovered the ancient homeworld of the Yuht, but alas, someone else must have recently paid a visit to this world. The [From.GetPlanetMoon] has been stripped clean of almost anything of value.\n\nHowever, with fine tuning of our sensors, which received precise calibration during our previous investigation of Yuht artifacts, we discover a deep cave whose entrances had long been collapsed under barrage of an ancient war. The debris is left undisturbed. Maybe something valuable remains there?"

 precursor.615.desc:0 "The hidden cache is far from plenty, but we still manage to learn from it a lot of Yuht technology and their history. Being the lone intelligent life for most of a million years, they hastily descended into a panic war against other intelligent lifeform they finally encountered. That war brought their demise."
 precursor.1110.desc:0 "We have discovered the location of [From.GetName], presumed central world of the League. Preliminary survey found massive cities sprawl across surface of the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. We shall hurry to carry out detailed investigation on it, lest other empires come and loot it."
 precursor.1111.desc.a:0 "§Y[From.From.GetName]§! was the administrative center of the First League throughout most of its existence, and served as the seat of their Great Senate. The [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] was densely populated, with a planet-wide city covering most of the surface. Food had to be imported from other member worlds to support the untold billions living in this enormous metropolis.\n\nWhen the League collapsed, these food shipments ceased virtually overnight. Those with the means departed for other worlds, but most of the population remained behind. Mass starvation and anarchy followed as the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon] was carved up between warlords and criminal organizations.\n\nThe population continued to dwindle for a few centuries until the planet had been reduced to little more than a lifeless ghost world - a final epitaph of the First League."
 precursor.1111.desc.b:0 "$precursor.1111.desc.a$\n\nWith data we gathered through previous investigation of artifacts of the League, we managed to locate some addtional vaults of treasures that left behind by the riches as well."
 precursor.1112.desc.a:0 "We have finally discovered the capital of the ancient First League. Unfortunately, we are too late. Someone else has been here recently, and most things of value are long gone.\n\nThere is an exception, though. Data from our previous investigation of artifacts of the League point to a well hidden treasury vault in a slum, which seemed to have escaped attention of native and offworld looters."

 precursor.1114.desc.b:0 "§Y[From.Owner.GetName]§! just announced they had completed excavation of treasures from the city world. Our xenoarcheologist team wasn't quick enough to recover anything valuable.\n\nThe good news is that §Ythe [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]§! didn't find the hidden treasure we learned from our previous investigation of League artifacts, so we can still retrieve it."
 precursor.1115.desc:0 "The treasues aren't as plenty as we thought, but still earn us a good profit and some insights into League's history. The city world was sustained by in-flow of offworld foods. When food in-flow stopped along side with collapse of central authority, the civilization collapsed, too."
 precursor.1610.desc:0 "We have discovered the location of presumed Irassian homeworld. Preliminary survey found lots of interesting items around the [From.GetPlanetMoon]. We shall hurry to carry out detailed investigation on it, lest other empires come and loot it."
 precursor.1611.desc.a:0 "Irassia - the former homeworld of the Irassian Concordat. Someone has relatively recently (within the last 2,000 years) gone through the trouble of systematically bombarding every square meter of the [From.From.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface from orbit - possibly a misguided attempt to keep the Javorian Pox from resurfacing.\n\nDespite this, the surface is still covered in the fossilized remains of the billions of Irassians who succumbed to the plague in the final years of their empire. By the time it had spread to their homeworld, most of the worlds in the Irassian Concordat had already fallen, and their alien vassals were in open revolt.\n\nJudging by ancient satellite logs recovered from orbit, the mood among the population on the Irassian homeworld was largely resigned by this point. The widespread panic that accompanied the first outbreaks of the pox on the colonies was largely absent, as most had come to accept the fact that the end was drawing near."
 precursor.1611.desc.b:0 "$precursor.1611.desc.a$\n\nWith schema of structure design we gathered through previous investigation of Irassian artifacts, we managed to locate some desperate sealed rooms whose occupants managed to escape the plague, only died of dehydration and starvation.
