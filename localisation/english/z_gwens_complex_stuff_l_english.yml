I've done the fleets thing before, and it's impossible to maintain any kind of coherent "personality" over such distances. My current consciousness would not survive the ordeal.\n\nBut a small fleet is fine. I can do that. If you want to, I could also assume a smaller form for fighting on the ground. Or... if you're feeling less violently inclined, I would be happy to assume the role of governor. Monoform society has always fascinated me.\n\nOf course, I will be able to switch roles on request, so you can easily reverse any decision you make."
