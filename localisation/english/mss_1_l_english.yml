 EMPIRE_DESIGN_PRESCRIPTED_ms_angry_birds_empire_desc: "In the universe, the cost of growth is immense. The flock of birds has paid with their appearance, names, and home. A young race has been enslaved by an evil entity and twisted into loathsome bird maidens. After the creator left, their home was reduced to ruins. Countless advanced or extreme civilizations have arisen and perished on the wasteland, but in the end, only the apocalyptic Emperor's grand collective plan has brought the bird maidens back to unity, at the cost of individual consciousness.\nThe universe is indeed a dark forest, and now, the bird maidens will ignite the forest with burning branches.\n§HWill NOT spawn naturally (can save template)§!\n§WIf spawn in game, §Ymost§! galaxy species will become maids.§!\n$MS_LABEL_SPECIES$"
