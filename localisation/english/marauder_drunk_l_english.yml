DRUNK_PICKET_BEHAVIOR_DESC:0 "§HFacebashing Experts:§! Facebasher's mission in life is to die so that other more importants won't die. To this end, they employ evasive maneuver assisted by their drunken stupor. (§Y30 Range§!)"
DRUNK_LINE_BEHAVIOR_DESC:0 "§HShooting Experts:§! Shooters are required to shoot at everything not marked for plundering. Assuming they were ever given proper instructions on what is marked or not. They still employ evasive maneuvers, with lesser degree of success. (§Y50 Range§!)"

marauder_galleon_khan: "Super-Galleon"

tech_dakka_artillery: "Dirty Cannon"
tech_dakka_artillery_desc: "Truly ugly and revolting. this Dirty Cannon is what passes for pirates and thugs who have no resources to make proper military-grade weapons. To much of our admiral's dismay however, some scientists do suggest that these cannons do have exceptionally high rate of fire. IF we are willing to bear ourselves to use it."

tech_dakka_titan: "The Pirate's Technological Marvel"
tech_dakka_titan_desc: "It is truly wonder that all the contraiptions that hold this crude titanic-sized spinal mount does not break down at all. The Marauders sure seem to have endless supplies of asteroids they can throw, seeing as how most of their ships are literally made out of them. As crude, ugly and unreliable as they may be, the admirals seem to think it may be actually be quite fun to fire jet-propelled meteors onto enemies once in a while. They would at least make for excellent meatshields against point-defenses. Our scientists heavily disapproved of this, such inelegance canot be allowed to tarnish our great scientific image! Hmmm.."
