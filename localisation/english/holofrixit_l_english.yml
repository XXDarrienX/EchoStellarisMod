 EMPIRE_DESIGN_holofrixit1_desc:0 "Holofrixits trace their origins to the frozen caverns of Zixiprat, an abandoned planet surrounded by the torn remains of ancient battleships and the ruins of forgotten civilizations. \n \n A seamless union between organic and cybernetic matter, the Holofrixits are a young but prolific species. United under the Xechiros, the free-thinking administrative caste, they have quickly overrun the desolate, arctic plains of their homeworld, greedily feeding on electrical discharges pouring from the power plants of their predecessors. \n \n With the resources of their homeworld depleted, the rulers of the Holosphere started to turn their gaze to the stars. Able to phase in and out of a virtual reality of their own making, the Holofrixits have started to create holographic starfleets, plugging their conciousness in their servers and projecting themselves into space..."
