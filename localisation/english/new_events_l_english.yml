 socialist.302.name:0 "Galactic Republic Dissolved"
 socialist.302.desc:0 "The Galactic Community has concluded voting on the matter of upholding the §YGalactic Republic§! itself. With a comfortable majority, the Republic has been disbanded, and the §YGalactic Custodian§! has been stripped of its powers. \n\nAcross the Galaxy, this development has been met with harsh reactions - whether positive or not. The situation has for sure changed the Galactic balance, and who knows what might be next for the galaxy...\n\nPerhaps it was the right thing to do."

 socialist.302.b:0 "Finally!"
 socialist.302.c:0 "It might have been for the better..."

 socialist.304.name:0 "The Republic Dissolves"
 socialist.304.normal.desc:0 "With the rise of the Galactic Empire, the question about the formal dissolution of the Galactic Republic has been gaining momentum. While the Republic still existed in mere political forms, it has been succeeded by the Imperium. As such, today, in a lavish ceremony, the Galactic Republic has been officially dissolved. \n\nNow that the Republic is gone, the Galactic Imperium has used its new powers to remove any traces still left of the Republic's existence. Republic Admirals, Generals and soldiers were required to swear a new oath of allegiance to the Emperor. \n\nThe Galactic Republic is now history."
 socialist.304.a:0 "Ok"

 socialist.306.normal.desc:0 "Citing the rising threats to the integrity of the Republic, the §YGalactic Community§! has ratified the creation of a Grand Army of the Republic, which will primarily consist of altered clones. \n\nThese soldiers are made in ideal conditions, using extensive growth-acceleration technology, they have a short lifespan but are incredible versatile. \n\nA built-in inhibitor chip forces these soldiers to be loyal to the Republic. While many in the Community have condemned this as 'legal slavery', it was appereantly not enough to secure a majority in the Community. For now, the Republic can count on these heroes to protect its integrity."
 socialist.306.a:0 "A significant development."

 socialist.307.name:0 "Directive 66 Initiated"
 socialist.307.desc:0 "With the rise of our Galactic imperium, many wondered what was to happen to the Clone armies who had previously served under the Republic chain of command. That question has now been answered. \n\nIn what can only be described as a brilliant move, we have used the inhibitor chips inside the Clones to manipulate them into believing that the Empire is the rightful successor state to the Galactic Republic. As such, they have been instructed to hunt anyone who might dare to contest our might. \n\nPer directive of the Emperor, they have been ordered to destroy the Cloning facilities where they were born. Time will tell if they are truly effective in this task."
 socialist.307.a:0 "Excellent."
 socialist.307.a.tooltip:0 "The remnants of the Republic are being swept away."

 socialist.308.name:0 "Clone Facilities Destroyed"
 socialist.308.desc:0 "Following the directive of the Emperor, the Clones have succeeded in destroying the Clone facilities of the former Galactic Republic. These facilities were designed to house thousands of clones, ready for deployment, but now that the Republic is no more, there is no need for these inferior soldiers anymore.\n\nAfter subjecting the facilities to heavy bombardment, Ground Teams moved in to secure the remnants of the facility, and reports indicate there are no confirmed survivors left. The remaining Clones aboard these vessels have proven themselves loyal to the Imperium.\n\nThe clones are now no more than a band of artifacts of the past. The Imperium requires hardened and trained men, and has no use for these incompetent lapdogs."
 socialist.308.a:0 "From the ashes of the old, the new rises!"
 socialist.308.a.tooltip:0 "Republic Clones can no longer be trained."

 socialist.309.name:0 "Universal Rights of the Citizen Adopted"
 socialist.309.desc:0 "After a long and heated debate, the §YGalactic Community§! has ratified the Universal Rights of the Citizen. This resolution states that all member nations of the Community must adopt a declaration that gives rights to minorities, and furthers the rights of already settled groups. \n\nAcross the Galaxy, Egalitarian empires welcome this resolution, seeing it as hard evidence that the Galactic Republic is truly there for the people. But there is also backlash from several nations, who see it as an attempt to 'destablize the status-quo'. Some have even gone as far as to call it a 'Xeno-Invasion'. \n\nFact is, this resolution will truly have consequences. Only time will tell what exactly these might be." 
 socialist.309.a:0 "A huge leap forward for the Galaxy!"
 socialist.309.b:0 "What utter nonsense is this?"
 socialist.309.b:0 "A significant development."

 socialist.310.name:0 "Universal Rights of the Citizen"
 socialist.310.desc:0 "The Galactic Community has adopted the Universal Rights of the Citizen. This declaration states that we have to give rights to minority groups, and further the rights of our own species. While this might be possible politically, it is up to you to decide."
 socialist.310.a:0 "From the ashes of the old, the new rises!"
 socialist.310.a.tooltip:0 "Republic Clones can no longer be trained."
