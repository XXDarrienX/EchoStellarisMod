 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_INFESTED_HIVE_MIND:0 "At first, it was difficult to extend our will on our world. Very few species would let themselves become part of our collective.\n\nBut over time, we learned how to take control and spread through other individuals.\nAfter a while, it was our main way of expansion.\n\nOne particular species was both very receptive to our Controllers, and strong enough to sustain itself while applying the will of our Mind.\n\nBut we fear it might not be enough.\n\nOur collective now turns to the stars, in search of other species.\nOf other Hosts."
 
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_RESOURCE_COLLECTOR_HIVE:0 "Since the birth of our Mind, our drones have always been drawn towards shiny minerals, copious food, and other plentiful sources of raw materials.\n\nThis allowed us to quickly take control of most of our world, and make sure our Hive would never lack of anything.\n\nOver the centuries, our brain drones broke more and more secrets of the universe, until finally allowing our Hive to travel across the stars.\n\nWe guided our drones for resources for many years, and we will continue to do so in the cold expanse of space."
 
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_KNOWLEDGE_DRIVEN_COLLECTIVE:0 "Our Hive was always driven by a strange curiosity. What was our place here? How did our Collective start? How did the universe occur?\n\nThe Mind focused most of its attention and resources into our Brain Drones, always wanting to know more and more about our universe.\n\nAfter assuming control of most of our world, the next logical step was to learn how to access the stars, and expand our Hive on new worlds.\n\nWho knows what is left to discover?"
