 FHMP.51.name: "Abnormal Architecture"
 FHMP.51.desc: "During survey of §Y[From.GetName]§!, the [Root.GetName] has found evidence that an ancient alien civilization was once active on this [From.GetPlanetMoon]. Among the ruins of a once grand city, a single building still stands, made from a wholly different, and much stronger, material than the rest, making it the only one to have stood the test of time.\n\nThe artifacts left behind by the former owners reveal that it once belonged to a spacefaring empire who called themselves the §YIxardian Corporation§!.\n\nJudging by the age of these artifacts, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] believe they were active in this region of space some 800 000 years ago."
 ixardian_digsite_1: "Differing Architecture"
 ixardian_digsite_1_intro: "This 800,000 year old building still stands, sorrounded by the ruins of a grand city, making it a good candidate for further investigations."
 FHMP.52.name: "Multispecies Society"
 FHMP.52.desc: "After studying the nearby ruins and comparing the artifacts found there with those found in the building our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have concluded that the city and the building was  built and owned by two different empires. Whatever the Ixardian Corporation's purpose was, they at least seem to have lived peacefully alongside their hosts."
 FHMP.53.name: "A Place For Trade"
 FHMP.53.desc: "After further studies of the items left behind on [from.Planet.GetName], our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] has concluded that the building was once a bustling center of trade, owned by The Ixardian Corporation, where the Ixardians would provide wares and services to the natives of the [from.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] in exchange for energy credits, a currency which somehow still existed back then."
 FHMP.54.name: "A Trail Of Credits"
 FHMP.54.desc: "While most of the equipment belonging to the ancient traders has long since stopped working, one of the computer terminals appears to be in a working condition, and was presumably used to transfer energy credits to what we assume is their headquarters or home empire. By inserting a miniscule amount of energy credits into the machine, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] has been able to track the emitted signals to [event_target:new_ixardian_digsite.solar_system.GetName], a system not too far from here."

 # Emergency Escape
 ixardian_digsite_2: "Abandoned Colony"
 ixardian_digsite_2_intro: "This Ixardian Colony has been completely ruined by orbital bombardments. Not a single building still stands."
 FHMP.55.name: "Vanished"
 FHMP.55.desc: "Despite throughout investigation of the ruins, no trace of Ixardian remains has been found. It's as if they just vanished, leaving their belongings to be destroyed by some unknown enemy."
 FHMP.55.a: "Disconcerting"
 FHMP.56.name: "Evacuation Notice"
 FHMP.56.desc: "During the investigation of the ruins on [from.Planet.GetName], the [root.GetName] has begun recieving transmissions from the planet, eminating from somewhere else in the system. After translating the message, it was revealed to be an evacuation notice sent to the Ixardians who worked on the [from.Planet.GetPlanetMoon], telling them to evacuate immediately.\nThe message does not reveal the reason for the evacuation, but there's no signs of the Ixardians having returned to the [from.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] after their evacuation."
 FHMP.56.a: "Disconcerting"
 FHMP.57.name: "Tracing The Signal"
 FHMP.57.desc: "Our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] has succesfully traced the transmissions to [event_target:new_ixardian_digsite.GetName], a [event_target:new_ixardian_digsite.GetPlanetMoon] where we have found the remains of a crashed Ixardian starbase. How it ended up there is unknown, but it would be unwise to ignore it."

 FHMP.59.a: "End Transmission"

 # Crashed Starbase
 ixardian_digsite_3: "Crashed Starbase"
 ixardian_digsite_3_intro: "This crashed starbase is transmitting various messages into space, most being variations of evacuation notices and messages informing about attempts at reestablishing contact with the Ixardian headquarters"
 FHMP.60.name: "Trading Station"
 FHMP.60.desc: "After gaining access to the starbases interior, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have managed to extract data from the starbases internal database. Most of it was simple recordkeeping of the transactions going through this star system, although they also managed to find a large number of pre-recorded messages. The last one simply says:\n\n§HIn case of §!§RERROR: Data Corrupted§!§H, proceed to your nearest evacuation shuttle in a safe and orderly fashion.§!"
 FHMP.60.a: "Ok"
 FHMP.61.name: "Ancient Trade Route"
 FHMP.61.desc: "After carefully sifting through the collected transaction data, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have managed to recreate the most dominant trade routes that passed through this system.\n\nAccording to our collected data, the Ixardian Corporation specialized in manifactured goods, exchanging it for more basic resources with other empires. By figuring out where these resources were sent to, we can find the locations of the Ixardian Corporations core systems where their factories were located."
 FHMP.61.a: "Send us the coordinates"
 
 # Refitted / reconfigured / modified Factory
 
 ixardian_digsite_4: "Ancient Factory"
 ixardian_digsite_4_intro: "This ancient factory was once owned by the Ixardian Corporation, which used it to produce many of the items they sold to other empires."
 FHMP.62.name: "Weapon Production"
 FHMP.62.desc: "After initial explorations of the factory ruins, the factory was revealed to be a weapons production site, which is contradicting everything we know thus far about the Ixardian Corporation, who only sold goods for civilian or scientific purposes."
 FHMP.63.name: "Changed Focus"
 FHMP.63.desc: "After further investigation of the factory, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] are certain that the factory's production equipment was repurposed from production of civilian goods to military weapons. This radical shift in Ixardian Behavior appears to have happened at the very end of the Ixardian Corporation's lifetime, suggesting the change happened due to an external threat to the megacorporation."
 FHMP.64.name: "Battle Plans"
 FHMP.64.desc: "Our excavation team on [From.Planet.GetName] has managed to find an intact database in the weapons factory, and retrieved its contents. Besides the expected production data, showing how many wares they made each day, the database also has a hastily made battle plan of sorts, showing the Ixardian space, as well as that of serveral others. Of particular note is the [event_target:ixardian_first_system.GetName] system, which lies in the territory of an empire called the 'Tirian Purifiers' and is marked as 'evacuated'. The map also shows the Ixardian Corporations home system, or headquarters as they called it."
 
 # Home system located
 
 FHMP.66.name: "Ixardian Home System Located"
 FHMP.66.desc: "After intense study of the recovered star chart, scientists on §Y[Root.Capital.GetName]§! have managed to deduce the exact galactic coordinates of Ixar Vir - the home system of the ancient Ixardian civilization! We should launch an expedition to this system before someone else beats us to it."
 
 # Corporate Headquarters
 
 ixardian_digsite_5: "Ixardian Headquarters"
 ixardian_digsite_5_intro: "Once the headquarters of the Ixardian Corporation, the ruined city of Vecaar Ix is now completely abandoned."
 
 FHMP.67.name: "Ancient Headquarters"
 FHMP.67.desc: "For the first time in nearly 800 000 years, sentient beings enter the corporate headquarters of the Ixardian Corporation. [Root.Leader.GetName] has reported that a lot of the capital holds absolutely nothing of value, most likely having been taken by the last Ixardians as they seemingly abandoned their homeworld."
 FHMP.68.name: "Database Found"
 FHMP.68.desc: "After combing through the ruins, [Root.Leader.GetName] and [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] team have found something of note, a working Ixardian databse, though unlike those found so far, this one is designated as a 'gift' of sorts for alien explorers. Work into extracting the contents are underway."
 FHMP.69.name: "The War"
 FHMP.69.desc: "The Database contains a message to whomever may find it.\n\nwhich is us.\n\nIt is an almost complete retelling of the events that led to the downfall of the Ixardian Corporation.\nWhile at first, the Ixardians were peaceful traders, a much older empire, called the 'Tirian Purifiers', attacked one of the Ixardian Corporation's customers. Instead of helping their ally, they instead chose to evacuate their branch offices, leaving them to their fate. When their former ally had fallen, the Tirian Purifiers didn't slow down, and instead continued their crusade against all alien empires, leaving ruins in their wake."
 FHMP.70.name: "Hollow Victory"
 FHMP.70.desc: "After most empires of the galaxy had fallen, the Ixardians knew they would be next soon, and despite being a traditionally pacifistic society, they began repurposing their factories for military production and educated their fleets for war. While the Tirian Purifiers were an impressive foe, their forces had been stretched thin due to their decade-long war against the rest of the galaxy, allowing the Ixardians to turn the tide with their hastily-produced navy. Despite their victory, the Ixardians paid the price for taking so long in joining the war, as their costumers had all been eradicated by the purifiers.\n\nThe Ixardian Corporation, being heavily dependant on trade for their basic resources, used up their last stockpiles in less than a year.\n\nAlas, the Ixardian Corporation was no more."
 FHMP.70.a: "Take the database. It's our property now"

 FHMP.101.name: "Strange Signal"
 FHMP.101.desc: "During survey of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetName] has recieved a signal from the [From.GetPlanetMoon], although the transmission, if it can even be classified as one, was comprised entirely out of static. Whatever is transmitting this signal, it surely is worth investigating."
 werediran_digsite_1: "Static Signal"
 werediran_digsite_1_intro: "Something on this [Planet.GetPlanetMoon] is transmitting a signal into space, with seemingly no purpose."
 FHMP.102.name: "Broadcast Tower"
 FHMP.102.desc: "After following the signal, the crew of the [Root.GetName] has arrived at the signal's source, an ancient radio tower that looks just like those made by the [Root.Owner.GetName] before the discovery of Faster-Than-Light travel, which is unnerving to say the least."
 FHMP.103.name: "Reclaimed By Nature"
 FHMP.103.desc: "After reaching the tower, the crew of the [Root.GetName] has been able to enter the small amount of ruined buildings in it's vicinity, all of which have been overgrown by the local flora. Despite this, most of the ruins have survived until now in a decent condition, and the tower have been determined to have been built around 500 000 years ago. How it is still functioning is beyond our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] abilities to answer."
 FHMP.104.name: "Unfinished"
 FHMP.104.desc: "While the tower itself is transmitting an endless stream of useless static out into space, the small collection of buildings around the tower have yielded some answers for our [Root.Owner.GetArchaeologistPlural]. Apparently the tower was not finished, according to the documents found in some of the ancient houses of the sorrounding village, including a blueprint of the tower.\n\nDespite the scale of the tower and it's advanced technology, it appears as if the society that built it was nothing more than primitives, barely able to leave their own planet, constructing something far beyond their ability to comprehend. How or why they did this is unknown."

 werediran_digsite_2: "Mysterious Signal"
 werediran_digsite_2_intro: "We have recieved a signal from somewhere on this planet. We should investigate it."
 FHMP.107.name: "Identical Tower"
 FHMP.107.desc: "After tracking down the source of the signal, our team was surprised to see a radio tower identical to the one we found on [event_target:werediran_planet_1.GetName], which should be impossible, considering the one on [event_target:werediran_planet_1.GetName] was made by primitives incapable of interstellar travel."
 FHMP.108.name: "Primitive Technology"
 FHMP.108.desc: "The tower on this [from.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] also appears to have been made around 500 000 years ago, by primitives in an atomic-age society, judging by the city ruins found in the vicinity. This, however, does not seem to have been a hindrance to the tower builders, who had managed to complete the advanced construction. What happened to the soicety is unknown, but our leading [Root.Owner.GetArchaeologistPlural] believe their grand project distracted them from more important concerns, ultimately leading to their downfall."
 FHMP.109.name: "The Signal"
 FHMP.109.desc: "While investigating the ruins and the tower itself, [Root.Leader.GetName] managed to stumble upon some new information in the form of a data log made by the tower builders. According to it, the tower was built shortly after the primitive society on [from.Planet.GetName] detected a signal from space dubbed the 'Werediran Signal'. The tower's purpose appears to be to amplify this signal, although why they wanted to do that is, as of yet, unknown."
 FHMP.110.name: "Recorded Transmission"
 FHMP.110.desc: "After extracting the rest of the information, we have found serveral logs detailing the findings of the tower builders, including a recording of a transmission almost identical to the one we recieved from this system, confirming that it was the Werediran Signal.\n\nMany of our leading [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] believes it's likely we'll recieve more of these transmissions from other systems if more towers exist."

 werediran_digsite_3_intro: "A giant satellite dish stands out among the ruins found on this [Planet.GetPlanetMoon]'s surface."
 FHMP.113.name: "Observation Post"
 FHMP.113.desc: "After having set up a small camp at the satellite dish, [Root.Leader.GetName] and [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] team has determined the structure to be from around the time that the towers were made by the primitives on the other planets, and it's clear that this place once served as an observation post intended to catch any signals from space. The station appears to be in good condition, and the [Root.GetName] should be able to power it, using its reactor as a temporary power source."
 FHMP.114.name: "Operational"
 FHMP.114.desc: "After powering on the ancient station, our [Root.Owner.GetArchaeologistPlural] have gained access to the computer terminals. The data revealed this place to have been a listening post where the inhabitants of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] searched for signals from other intelligent species. While most of the data shows that space around them was empty at the time, a sudden spike in activity happened at some point during their civilizations lifetime."

This greatly motivated their civilization to invent a way to travel the stars, according to the ancient logs."
 FHMP.116.name: "Blueprints Recovered"
 FHMP.116.desc: "During exploration of the listening post, our excavation team has stumbled upon quite a find: A blueprint on a data drive, detailing how to build an amplifying tower just like the one we found on [event_target:werediran_planet_1.GetName], although due to the higher technology level of this blueprint, we have been able to learn much more from it, including how to make one ourselves, which several of our top [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have been pushing for. They hope it will allow us to pinpoint the signal's source.\n\nThe purpose of amplifying the Werediran Signal was, however, not revealed, although it's clear that it wasn't the natives on this planet that made these blueprints, rather they recieved them."

 FHMP.151.name: "Broken Planet"
 FHMP.151.desc: "While surveying what we first assumed was a fairly normal barren world, the crew of the [Root.GetName] discovered that the planet was in fact broken. A huge chunk of the planet appears to have been blasted from the planet, exposing the planet's core to space.\n\nIt would be a good idea to investigate what happened here."
 
 # Broken Planet
 
 ezentian_digsite_1: "Ancient Machinery"
 ezentian_digsite_1_intro: "Ancient machinery can be found all around this great hole in the planet's crust, although most of it has been destroyed beyond recognition."
 FHMP.152.name: "$FHMP_ezentian_empire$"
 FHMP.152.desc: "While most of the ancient machinery is shattered and has thus far been unidentifiable, besides the fact that it was once part of some machine or structure, a small amount have survivied, all of which has been engraved with the insignia of an empire calling themselves the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$.\n\nIt appears as if this place was the site of a large-scale mining operation some 3,400,000 years ago, although it's uncertain how they managed to create a hole in the planet of this size."
 FHMP.153.name: "Signs Of Battle"
 FHMP.153.desc: "Contrary to what we believed at first, not all of the scrap metal and destroyed structures stem from the mining operation, as a lot of it has been determined to have been destroyed by lasers and other weapons of war.\n\nPerhaps the mining operation was just collateral damage, or maybe it was the target of a military operation, in any case this new discovery means that there might be shipwrecks or other remains from the battle other places in this system, that we may have overlooked earlier."
 FHMP.154.name: "Crashed Ship"
 FHMP.154.desc: "After a bit of searching, we have found the remains of a crashed ship on the [event_target:new_ezentian_digsite.GetPlanetMoon] [event_target:new_ezentian_digsite.GetName]. It has no visible exterior weapons and is much larger than the average civilian ship."

 ezentian_digsite_2_intro: "This ancient ship crashed on this [Planet.GetPlanetMoon] a long time ago. While it is in disrepair, it surprisingly appears to have survived the crash in one piece."
 
 FHMP.155.name: "Mining Ship"
 FHMP.155.desc: "After finding and gaining access to the ship's bridge, [Root.Leader.GetName] recovered many files from the ship's surviving terminals. The recovered data classifies the ship as an Ezentian Colossus-Class Mobile-Mining Platform, featuring a 'high-grade mining beam'. How it worked is as of yet unknown, although it's possible that it has something to do with the hole found on [event_target:FHMP_first_digsite_planet.GetName]."
 FHMP.156.name: "Planet Destroyer"
 FHMP.156.desc: "After much search, the crew of the [Root.GetName] has found the 'mining beam', a device created by the Ezentians to access the valuable minerals and metals in a planet's core. By analyzing its construction, it has been determined that it is in fact just an enourmous thermic energy beam, designed in a way to crack open planets. A terrifying weapon for sure, although this one is beyond repair."

The scale of the forge indicates that it was made to run non-stop, spewing out a never-ending stream of alloys."
 FHMP.171.name: "Storage Facility"
 FHMP.171.desc: "Not far from the forge, our exploration team has found a large Storage Facility, filled to the brim with alloys. There's also a terminal in the facility, which our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] has begun recovering files from. Hopefully they will reveal more about this facility."

 FHMP.174.name: "One Against Many"
 FHMP.174.desc: "After looking through more of the wrecked ships, [Root.Leader.GetName] has concluded that most of the empires were part of a federation made up of many species, with many ships featuring equipment designed for multi-species use. The Ezenti, on the other hand, did not have any allies, although they made up for that disadvantage with superior technology and better equipped ships."
 FHMP.175.name: "Defeat"
 FHMP.175.desc: "From the data we have collected from the ships, this battle appears to have been a last ditch attempt from the Ezentians at winning the war. They didn't fare well, and their remaining navy was destroyed in this battle, leaving the federation free to enter their home system.\nWe have also obtained some data on the location of this system\n\nIf we find more information about it, we may be able to learn it's location."
 
 # Harvested Planet
 
 ezentian_digsite_5: "Harvested Planet"
 ezentian_digsite_5_intro: "Around the time of the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$, [Planet.GetName] was targeted by their mining operations. Now a gaping hole in the planet bears witness to the events that took place."
 
 FHMP.177.name: "Core Tap"
 FHMP.177.desc: "According to our scans of [From.Planet.GetName], its metallic core has been drained by a large amount, most likely having been tapped by the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$ and used for construction of space-bound structures or ships, although they for some reason did not take it all."
 FHMP.178.name: "Attacked"
 FHMP.178.desc: "After some investigations of the area of the hole, conducted by [Root.Leader.GetName] and [Root.Leader.GetHerHis] crew aboard the [Root.GetName], we have found evidence that this mining operation was stopped due to an attack by enemies of the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$, leaving large parts of the [From.Planet.GetPlanetMoon] unexploited.\n\nA number of wrecked ships still remain on the surface, having been shot down while they were fleeing."
 FHMP.179.name: "A Declaration Of War"
 FHMP.179.desc: "While most of the crashed ships are civilian ships used by the workers of the mining operation, a few also bear weapons and an insignia different from that of the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$, most likely being a ship from another empire.\n\nWhat few defenses the Ezentians had must have been successful in shooting down a few of these attackers, although not enough to save the many fleeing civilians."
 FHMP.180.name: "Route To The Capital"
 FHMP.180.desc: "After collecting a partially intact escape shuttle that had miraculously survived not only the incoming attacks, but also the crash back down onto the surface, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have worked hard extracting and restoring the pre-programmed route from the shuttle's computational system.\n\nWhile they were unable to restore everything, a lot of the data was successfully restored, revealing the destination to be their home system.\n\nIf we find more information about it, we may be able to learn it's location."

 FHMP.182.name: "The Mural"
 FHMP.182.desc: "After searching through most of the building, we have found a memorial of sorts: A giant mural detailing the events that happened 3,400,000 years ago: At that time, the Ezentians made a gigantic ship, bigger than any before that, designated as a 'colossus', which they equipped with their 'mining beam'.\n\nMany empires at the time were afraid of this new weapon, although the Ezentians claimed they would never use it for war. They then banded together in a federation in the face of this new 'threat'."
 FHMP.183.name: "The War"
 FHMP.183.desc: "The mural text continues on about how the federation, calling themselves the 'Galactic Defense Force' made a pre-emptive strike against the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$, disrupting their mining operations and destroying their colossi. This quickly escalated to a galaxy-wide war with the federation on one side and the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$ on the other."
 FHMP.184.name: "The Ezentian Defeat"
 FHMP.184.desc: "After defeating the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$ in the battle for the [event_target:FHMP_ezentian_battle_planet_target.GetName] system, the Galactic Defense Force entered the Ezentian system where they bombarded the ringworlds the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$ had spent the last few decades building, their grand project. Although they celebrated their victory, a few of the federation members felt guilty for destroying the $FHMP_ezentian_empire$, having doubts about whether or not this attack was justified.\n\nThe mural was made by some of these empires in secret, and later they also restored this section of the ringworld to its former glory, although time has taken its toll since then."
 FHMP.185.name: "The Last Remains Of The $FHMP_ezentian_empire$"
 FHMP.185.desc: "To prevent anyone from making any more colossus-class ships, the Galactic Defense Force destroyed almost all of the colossi they could find, including all research on the subject. There's instructions on the mural on where to find one of the few remaining colossi cores that were hidden before the Galactic Defense Force found it.\n\nThe last line of the mural simply says '§YWe're Sorry§!."
