 mem_wpdr.4.desc:0 "§Y[Leader.GetName]§! reports successfully boarding and studying the interior of §SIndomitable Valor§! - a massive battleship found in the [capital_ship.Solar_System.GetName].\n\nAccording to its datacore, the ship was built and operated by the §SUniversal Transport Alliance§!, an organization formed in the aftermath of some kind of galactic political crisis several thousand years ago. Many powers present at the time had collapsed, leaving trade routes unprotected and vulnerable to rising piracy, until this non-government organization stepped in. The Alliance operated a number of massive capital ships, such as the Indomitable Valor, known as §YMobile Weapon Deployment Rigs§!, which manufactured small automated ships capable of effectively pursuing pirate vessels and engaging them with long-range weapons.\n\nFor a while, the Alliance was generously financed by governmental and private benefactors and able to not only push back the piracy, but also heavily invest in its own infrastructure. However, as the pirate threat diminished and the Alliance's power grew, various forces became dissatisfied with the UTA's dominance and demanded its dissolution.\n\nMost of its officers eventually defected to their native empires, and those who didn't were hunted down. The Indomitable Valor was the last remaining Rig to defend the Alliance's headquarters, but was forced to retreat eventually. It appears that its enemies decided not to pursue the lone ship knowing its capabilities and as time went on the crew slowly abandoned, leaving it in an automated defense mode.\n\nNow, the ship is damaged beyond repair. We were, however, able to extract the Manufacturing Matrix responsible for creating new platforms."

Its intentions appear hostile."
