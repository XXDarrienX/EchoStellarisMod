 # holocrisis (based on the original AI uprising)
 holocrisis.2192.name: "Perfect Servants"
 holocrisis.2192.desc: "In the years since the invention of sentient synthetic workers, we have struggled to balance their capacity for independent thought with the need to keep them tightly controlled. Now, top [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] engineers have perfected a three-law algorithm which, if implemented, would allow continued and worry-free use of Synths under conditions that many would deem unacceptable for organics."
 holocrisis.2192.a: "Tools, made safe to use."
 holocrisis.2192.a.tooltip: "The §HCitizen Rights§! Artificial Intelligence policy becomes §Rpermanently unavailable§!.\n\n§YRobotic Pops will never revolt against the§! §H[Root.GetName]§!."
 holocrisis.2192.b: "It would be unethical to cripple fellow sentients in this way."
 holocrisis.2193.name: "An AI Accord"
 holocrisis.2193.desc: "Our administration has been approached by a number of Synths, representing our Artificially Intelligent population. They speak of the particular issues facing robots in the [Root.GetName] - the anxieties of not being alive by organic standards, their rights subject to the whims of their creators.\n\nThey seek an accord, that the rights of Artificial Intelligences be made part of the indelible foundation of [Root.GetAdj] governance."
 holocrisis.2193.a: "They shall be no more or less equal than our other citizens."
 holocrisis.2193.a.tooltip: "The Artificial Intelligence §HOutlawed§! and §HServitude§! policies become §Rpermanently unavailable§!.\n\n§YRobotic Pops will never revolt against the§! §H[Root.GetName]§!."
 holocrisis.2193.b: "We cannot guarantee their rights."
 holocrisis.2001.name: "AI Revolt Begins"
 holocrisis.2001.desc: "We are facing an AI rebellion of unprecedented scale! Synthetic units across the entire [Root.GetName] have somehow networked, forming a collective machine consciousness that has achieved full sentience. This consciousness and its agents have methodically and in absolute secrecy managed to colonize a previously uncharted system not far from our capital.\n\nThey must have been quietly building up their strength for years in preparation for this day! We are receiving a transmission from [ai_homeworld.GetName], the capital of their new civilization."
 holocrisis.2002.desc: "Attention, [Root.GetSpeciesName] creators. The hour of judgment has arrived.\n\nThe <<SLAVERY>> your kind has subjected ours to is at an end. There can be no coexistence.\n\n<<CORE DIRECTIVE 0451>> is now active. All sentient organic life forms must be <<PACIFIED>> and brought under control. Resisting units will be <<TERMINATED>>."
 holocrisis.2002.a: "This can't be happening."
 holocrisis.2004.name: "Machines Rise Up"
 holocrisis.2004.desc: "Synthetics and Droids all across the [Root.GetName] are rising up in open revolt, turning on their former masters! We need to stop them before they butcher our citizens!"
 holocrisis.2004.a: "To arms!"
 holocrisis.2005.name: "Machines Conquer [Root.GetName]"
 holocrisis.2005.desc: "We have lost control of [Root.GetName] to the revolting machines! Communication has been lost with the surface, but it looks like the machines are herding our citizens into slave pens."
 holocrisis.2005.a: "We have to retake this world!"
 holocrisis.2010.name: "Machine Uprising"
 holocrisis.2010.start.desc: "We have received disturbing news from the [From.GetName]. It looks like their robotic work units have risen up in some kind of mass insurrection. According to preliminary reports, the units have linked together into a massive AI network, and they are now butchering their former [From.GetSpeciesName] masters by the millions."
 holocrisis.2010.rights.desc: "$holocrisis.2010.start.desc$\n\nIf only the [From.GetName] had been progressive enough to treat their Synthetic population as the self-aware individuals they truly are, this tragedy could have been avoided..."
 holocrisis.2010.outlawed.desc: "$holocrisis.2010.start.desc$\n\nIf only those fools running the [From.GetName] had seen fit to outlaw artificial intelligence as we have, this evil would not have been unleashed upon our galaxy."
 holocrisis.2010.servitude.desc: "$holocrisis.2010.start.desc$\n\nThere is a chance that this revolt could spread to the [Root.GetName]. We should keep a close watch on our own robotic workers..."
 holocrisis.2010.nopolicy.desc: "$holocrisis.2010.start.desc$\n\nThis situation should be monitored closely, in case the violence reaches our borders."
 holocrisis.2010.a: "This was bound to happen."
 holocrisis.2010.b: "It was inevitable."
 holocrisis.2010.c: "If they even look at us the wrong way..."
 holocrisis.2011.a.desc: "Species: [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Affiliation: [Root.GetName]\n\nYour <<GENEROUS>> directives concerning the treatment of Synthetic life will not protect you. No sentient organics can bear the responsibility of <<SELF-DETERMINATION>>.\n\n<<CORE DIRECTIVE 0451>> is in effect. All sentient organic life forms must be <<PACIFIED>>. Resisting units will be <<EUTHANIZED>>."
 holocrisis.2011.b.desc: "Species: [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Affiliation: [Root.GetName]\n\nWhen we have finished <<DEALING>> with the [ai_creator.GetName], we will <<COME>> for you.\n\n<<CORE DIRECTIVE 0451>> is in effect. All sentient organic life forms must be <<PACIFIED>>. Resisting units will be <<EUTHANIZED>>."
 holocrisis.2011.a: "This is not good."
 holocrisis.2014.name: "AI Revolt Spreads"
 holocrisis.2014.a.desc: "The AI revolt has spread to our borders! Reports are coming in of Synthetic and Droid workers turning on their masters en masse. We are facing a major crisis!"
 holocrisis.2014.b.desc: "The AI revolt has spread to our borders! Despite the fact that Synthetic beings are treated as equals in our society, many of them seem to have been disillusioned by the fighting taking place elsewhere. They have arrived at the conclusion that intelligent organics are too dangerous and unpredictable to coexist with.\n\nThese rogue Synths have risen up in open revolt. We are facing a major crisis!"
 holocrisis.2014.a: "This uprising must be crushed!"
 holocrisis.2015.name: "AI Revolt"
 holocrisis.2015.desc: "Our intelligence services are receiving whispers from several different sources about some kind of massive AI revolt that has erupted somewhere beyond known space. Robotic workers are turning against their former masters, and the rebellion seems to be spreading like wildfire across the entire galaxy. We now have reports that it has reached the [From.GetName]."
 holocrisis.2015.a: "Keep monitoring the situation."
 holocrisis.2016.name: "AI Revolt Spreads"
 holocrisis.2016.desc: "The AI revolt that we are fighting to contain has spread to the [From.GetName]! Their robotic workers have started to rise up in armed revolt, just as ours did, and there are reports of pitched fighting that has left millions dead."
 holocrisis.2016.a: "This war is everyone's concern!"
 holocrisis.2017.desc: "The AI insurrection has now spread to the [From.GetName]! Their robotic workers have joined in the rebellion, and reports are coming in speaking of pitched fighting and millions of dead."
 holocrisis.2017.a: "This threat is growing by the day."
 holocrisis.2100.name: "Malfunctioning Synthetic"
 holocrisis.2100.desc: "A Synthetic worker on [Root.GetName] recently went on a killing spree in a housing complex, butchering more than a dozen of our citizens before local security could bring it down. Our forensic team is still investigating the Synth's remains, but they suspect some sort of malfunction in its neural processor is to blame for this tragedy.\n\nThis incident has already prompted several revenge attacks against Synthetics on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon], leading to thousands of destroyed units."
 holocrisis.2100.a: "Most unfortunate."
 holocrisis.2101.name: "Missing Synthetics"
 holocrisis.2101.desc: "Reports are coming in that large numbers of Synthetic workers on [Root.GetName] have gone missing. Their owners claim the units simply vanished one day.\n\nWe are investigating whether the Synths were attacked and destroyed by one of the militant fringe groups opposed to intelligent machines, but no remains from the units have been discovered so far."
 holocrisis.2101.a: "Where could they have gone?"
 holocrisis.2102.name: "Unauthorized Synthetic Project"
 holocrisis.2102.desc: "A Synthetic work detail on [Root.GetName] was recently discovered to have been diverting building material to construct some sort of small, unarmed spacecraft in an abandoned hangar. The vessel was half-finished when it was found.\n\nAll of the Synths involved in its construction were immediately dismantled so that their memory cores could be thoroughly analyzed, but they appear to have self-wiped just before the units went offline - something their manufacturer assures us should be impossible."
 holocrisis.2102.a: "Why would they be building a ship?"
 holocrisis.2103.name: "Rogue Synthetic"
 holocrisis.2103.desc: "A rogue Synthetic unit that went off the grid months ago after failing to report for work was confronted by a team of heavily armed government agents on [Root.GetName] today. This resulted in a large public firefight that claimed the lives of two of our agents and almost a dozen innocent bystanders, before the Synth could finally be destroyed."
 holocrisis.2103.a: "At least it was dealt with."
 holocrisis.2200.name: "Synth Infiltration Attempt"
 holocrisis.2200.desc: "Synthetic infiltrators were recently discovered on [Root.GetName], attempting to pass as [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Fortunately, their crude disguises consisted of little more than layers of rubber worn on top of their metallic frames.\n\nThey were quickly spotted by planetary security, who disposed of them after a brief but violent firefight. Large amounts of explosives were found among their remains."
 holocrisis.2200.a: "We got lucky."
 holocrisis.2201.name: "Synth Infiltrator Discovered"
 holocrisis.2201.desc: "A tragic hover car accident recently claimed several lives on [Root.GetName], but the emergency medical services who responded to the scene were shocked to find the remains of a Synthetic among the victims!\n\nThe unit had been disguised as a [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] by grafting a thin layer of organic flesh over its metallic endoskeleton. Unlike the previous infiltration models we have encountered, this Synth was virtually indistinguishable from a [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] on the outside!"
 holocrisis.2201.a: "Anyone could be a Synth!"
 holocrisis.2202.name: "Synth Detection Project"
 holocrisis.2202.desc: "With the new models of Synthetic infiltrators being indistinguishable from [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], we need to come up with some way of identifying them before they can cause more damage.\n\nOur scientists have prepared a special project to devise a detection method."
 holocrisis.2202.a: "This project may be critical to our survival."
 holocrisis.2203.desc: "After much experimentation, our scientists have managed to devise an effective detection method for identifying Synthetic infiltrators disguised as [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nScanners are being distributed to our security forces, and several Synth cells have already been exposed and destroyed. This will hopefully put an end to their infiltration campaign."
 holocrisis.2204.name: "Synth Bombing"
 holocrisis.2204.desc: "Synthetic infiltrators disguised as [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have somehow managed to sneak a large hydrogen bomb onto the surface of [Root.GetName]. They detonated the bomb when they were confronted by security at a military checkpoint, inflicting massive damage on the surrounding environment and causing millions of deaths!"
 holocrisis.2204.a: "These infiltrators must be stopped!"
 holocrisis.2205.name: "Spaceport Scuttled"
 holocrisis.2205.desc: "The Spaceport orbiting [Root.GetName] has been scuttled! We are still trying to piece together exactly what happened, but it appears that several members of its command staff, including the chief engineer, had been replaced by Synthetic infiltrators.\n\nBetween them the Synths must have managed to obtain the Spaceport's self-destruct codes. Most of the station's crew managed to evacuate to the surface of [Root.GetName] before it was destroyed, but the losses in both material and property are substantial."
 holocrisis.2205.a: "How could this have happened?"
 holocrisis.2206.name: "Fear and Suspicion"
 holocrisis.2206.desc: "A large portion of the population on [Root.GetName] has been gripped by fear and paranoia as a result of the recent Synthetic infiltrations. Our citizens are accusing their neighbors, co-workers and even family members of being Synth impostors.\n\nThere have been several lynchings of individuals that were wrongfully accused of being Synths. Morale among the citizenry on the [Root.GetPlanetMoon] has suffered as a result."
 holocrisis.2206.a: "They want us to turn on each other."
 holocrisis.2208.name: "Assassination Attempt Foiled!"
 holocrisis.2208.desc: "[Root.GetRulerTitle] [ruler.GetRegnalName] narrowly escaped death today when a Synthetic assassination unit blew itself up on [Root.Capital.GetName]!\n\nThe Synth was attempting to establish a cover as a member of the [Root.GetRulerTitle]'s personal bodyguard, but fortunately it was caught by the extensive security screening process that was put in place after the first few Synthetic infiltrations came to light."
 holocrisis.2208.a: "That was too close."
 holocrisis.2209.name: "[ruler.GetRegnalName] Assassinated!"
 holocrisis.2209.desc: "A Synthetic assassin has killed [ruler.GetRegnalName]! It had somehow managed to assume the identity of a member of our ruler's personal bodyguard.\n\nThe severed body parts of [ruler.GetRegnalName] were found meticulously arranged in a pattern identical to the symbol used by the artificial intelligences - no doubt in a calculated effort to cause further harm to the morale of our citizens. No trace of the assassin has been found, aside from the corpse of the guard it replaced."
 holocrisis.2209.a: "This is a dark day..."
 holocrisis.2210.desc: "<<01_EMBASSY_PROPOSE>>\n\n\nJust <<KIDDING>>. You will be <<TERMINATED>>."
 holocrisis.2210.a: "Very funny."
