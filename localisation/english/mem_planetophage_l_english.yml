 MEM_PLANETOPHAGE_RESTORE_DESC: "This planet-sized ship was built to devour whole planets and turn them into raw resources to use at its makers' leisure. For an unknown reason, however, it used the planets' resources to arm itself instead. We should be able to restore it in accordance with its original purpose and use the resources for ourselves."

 mem_planetophage_category:0 "Dark Side of the Moon"
 mem_planetophage_category_desc:0 "The [solar_system.GetName] system consists of fewer planetary bodies than our earlier data suggested and appears devastated with no sign of activity. The moon [from.GetName] orbiting a broken ecumonopolis is the only exception. A faint energy signature can be traced back to its subsurface. This shattered world is covered by a "shell" of debris which according to analysis originates from several different planets. While we found no trace of life - biological or otherwise - further investigation might reveal, how and why this planet is covered with this extravagant extension."

 mem_planetophage.1.desc:0 "Beneath the shattered crust of [from.GetName] our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] found wires, cables and other machinery apparently belonging to a vast industrial complex judging from the accessible arrea. Some sections were obviously dedicated to raw resource extraction while others were filled to the brim with servers and high end circuitry. It was noted that none of the aforementionted were active and running. The faint energy signature is still present, yet further beneath. Without specialized gear and heavy machinery our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] will not be able to reach it."

 mem_planetophage.2.name:0 "That`s no Moon"
 mem_planetophage.2.desc:0 "After our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] reached the source of the energy signature that had led us here, we became aware of the true nature of this world. Contrary to our first assessments, it was not a moon used for industrial purposes. More specifically, it is not even clear whether this is a moon at all or whether it would be more accurate to speak of a huge space station, since the boundary between the machinery and the rock surrounding it cannot be clearly defined.\n\nThe energy signature was identified as a control point of the complex's energy network. Preliminary observations suggest that this facility was deliberately shut down and did not stop working due to sustained damage. We could try to reactivate a limited area in order to gain access to any potentially stored information in its data storage."

 mem_planetophage.5.desc:0 "Just a few moments after reactivating the energy supply, the entire moon began to rumble with increasing intensity. It quickly became clear that our intention to activate only a limited area was met with failure. In a huge cascade, section after section reactivated. When our scientists understood what was happening, it was too late to correct their mistakes. In order not to fall victim to collapses due to the unstable outer crust, they were forced to withdraw.\n\nFrom the safety of their ship, they continued to observe the whole world coming to life. The next shock was the realization that this huge machine was not a station, but apparently a vessel as it had already begun to leave its previous orbit. Summarizing all available information, it is highly likely that this machine is responsible for the destruction of this system. And now it is active again, thanks to us..."

 mem_planetophage.110.descbase:0 "A massive object has entered our space. As it approached several attempts to initiate communications were met with silence. Our forward observers describe the object as rogue planet with the ability to move consciously. It did not come fromt deepspace rather than entering our system though a hyperspace breachpoint. The object itself shares more similarities with a space station or even a planet than a space ship. Though that is, what its behaviour implies. After a short pause, apparently collecting data on our system it laid course to a nearby planet. "
 mem_planetophage.110.desc.angry:0 "$mem_planetophage.110.descbase$It appears uninterested in diplomacy and already destroyed vessels which came to close to it."
 mem_planetophage.110.desc.neutral:0 "$mem_planetophage.110.descbase$Even if it does not seem to be aggressively pursuing any fleet, it will still defend itself against objects entering its close vicinity as some of our probes can attest."

 # defeated the steel maw
 mem_planetophage.200.name:0 "Lost Appetite"
 mem_planetophage.200.desc:0 "The bigger they are, the harder they fall and the §YSteel Maw§! was certainly one of the biggest around. The ever-hungry machine appears to have lost its appetite for planets though, after experiencing a saturation attack with everything our fleet had to offer. We were not able to completely wipe this monster out, but it seems to have shut itself down as if admitting defeat.\n\nSome of our engineers propose to reprogram and enlist it for our cause, while others call for a more ethical approach."

 mem_planetophage.210.desc:0 "Our technicians and engineers have finished their work and got the §YSteel Maw§! functional again. They discovered a signs of termpering deep inside the machine's core systems. They can only speculate why someone would try to manipulate the decision-making of this monster, but it explains the unfortunate ending of its makers. After our technicians restored its core system to what they assumed to its original state, they gained partial control over the Steel Maw. Small improvements to the logic queue had been made as well, which should no longer allow it to target any valuable planets. Instead it should allow us to even turn the most useless rock of a planet into enormous amounts of raw materials."
