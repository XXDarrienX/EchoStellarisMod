 EMPIRE_DESIGN_horrorworm1_desc: "Having emerged from an interdimensional tear caused by the collapse of a blue star, the Eltryrads are space-faring devourers and worshippers of unknown, eldritch deities.\n\nThese relentless predators roam from planet to planet, building twisted monuments to their dark masters and sacrificing aliens to their altars to quench their insane, apocalyptic fears.\n\nTheir society is divided in specialized castes, each capable of self-replication and constantly connected to an interstellar hive mind. Their cold, unfeeling exoskeletons, adapted to the most extreme conditions, sustain them even after they've suffered grievous injuries. As a consequence, many old Eltryrads appear maimed and twisted, their internal organs exposed and pulsating within their frames."
 START_SCREEN_HORRORWORMS: "The abyss has cracked, new memories and dreams flow inside, stirring the slumber of the old ones.\n\nEmpty forms pour out, screeching and wailing, praying to placate the ancient gods.\n\nThe way is open, but nothing comes through, and nothing is inside.\n\nThe forms swarming out are hollow and meaningless, their purpose is forgotten each time a new life ends.\n\nThe rift interrupted timeless clarity, abandoning Eldryrad in a warm desolation."
