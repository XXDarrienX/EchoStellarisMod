# Global ship designs are pre-made ship designs used for events and galaxy setup. They work
# the same as other ship designs, except they're hand made instead of autogenerated.

# ship_design = {
# 	name = "NAME_design"					# Name for the design
# 	role = picket							# a string used to determine the ship build 
# 	upgrades_to = <global_ship_design>		# what design this upgrades to when growing up (for space fauna)
# 	creature_designer_template = yes/no		# Whether this design opens in the creature designer (yes) or the ship designer (no)
# 	newborn_ship_design = <design_name>		# For space fauna, what design to use when a ship with this design has an offspring
# 	country_type = <country_type>			# only countries with this type can use this design,

# A lot of values that used to be in ship designs were moved to growth stages, to allow for ships with multiple growth
# stages (ie bioships). Below is an array of all the growth stages this design uses.
# Note 1: due to the sheer amount of existing ship design, a backward compatibility layer was added so that if the fields are not in the array, they'll still be put on a single growth stage (most ships have only the one)
# 	growth_stages ={

# 			resource_restriction = { }		# irrelevant for global ship designs, this design won't be able to be built if it costs some of these resources
# 			custom_military_power = <value>	# force the design to have this specific military power instead of calculating it from components
# 			required_component = <component># name of a required component slot, you can have this field as many time as there are required components

# 	custom_design = yes/no		# Whether this a design made in the ship designer
# 	custom_upgrades_to = 		# internal field to store the reference to an upgrade (for space fauna). Calculated from upgrades_to (which is the name of a design)
