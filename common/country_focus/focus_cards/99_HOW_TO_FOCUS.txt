# EMPIRE FOCUSES
#
# There are four base categories of cards, which can be expanded in DLCs:
#
#   1. Core
#   2. Exploration
#   3. Conquest
#   4. Development
#
# When naming focuses, use the category name, underscore, tier number, and then two digits in increments of 5.
#   <category>_focus_<tier><num>
# Example 1: exploration_focus_100 (Exploration Focus, tier 1, number 00 where the next one would be 05)
# Example 2: exploration_focus_210 (Exploration Focus, tier 2, number 10 where the next one would be 15)
#
# The focus paramater 'base = base_card_type_key' is used to initialize the card type field values with the field values of the corresponding base card type.
# If used, this must be the first field. It's best practice to define a base focus per category tier, and refer to that from within the category tier.
#
# Localisation goes into localisation\english\focus_l_english.yml
