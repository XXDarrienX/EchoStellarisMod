# An explanation of usage_weight, spawn_chance and scaled_spawn_chance:

# - usage_weight: when the game picks which initialiser to use for a system, it selects randomly based on the relative weighting of the different system initialisers. (It then repeats several hundred times to spawn the galaxy)
# - spawn_chance: adds a random chance that a certain system does not spawn at all. Scale of 1-100 (100 is default and guarantees spawn being allowed). If it is 50, there is a 50% chance this initialiser will not be selected as a valid initialiser in a given game
# - scaled_spawn_chance: same as spawn_chance (replaces its usage). Amends the formula to: ( scaled_spawn_chance * total systems in galaxy ) / 100. I.e. 10 guarantees spawn being enabled in a huge galaxy.
