Every adventure requires a step into the unknown...

The Astral Planes Narrative Expansion focuses on mid to late game exploration content - travel to other dimensions to discover over 30 new branching storylines, 8 relics, 4 civics, the Riftworld origin, and new music composed by Andreas Waldetoft.

The Custodian team has completed our consolidation and revamp of leaders - Generals and Admirals have been merged into a single Commander class, and some of the tasks previously performed by Envoys are now part of the Officials class. Any leader can now become a Sector or Planetary governor, providing bonuses appropriate to their class. (Martial Law for Commanders, Economic bonuses for Officials, or Assist Research for Scientists.) The Minister of State Council position has been added to assist your diplomatic corps, and many leader traits have been updated or changed during this rebalancing.

On some storefronts, the in-game Additional Content Browser now provides much more accurate and detailed data about the contents of each DLC. You can preview shipsets and portraits, and view the detailed tooltips for things like Origins and Civics, letting you make more informed decisions before you consider picking up any of our releases.

We've also made some major upgrades to the Outliner, which now supports multiple tabs and much greater customization.

Please take a look at the full patch notes for more details.

A nearly infinite number of universes connect to our own, and ours is not the only one full of wonders. Have fun, and thanks for playing Stellaris!

WARNING: Due to the major changes from this leader consolidation, games predating 3.10 are likely to have unexpected results. We strongly recommend rolling back to 3.9.3 to complete these games.
