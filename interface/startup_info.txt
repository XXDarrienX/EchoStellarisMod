Welcome to Stellaris 3.9 'Caelum'!

Caelum is the Sculptor's Chisel, and in honor of that we've focused mostly on polishing and upgrading some of the oldest Species Packs in this one.

Just a few of the many changes include Plantoids now hitching rides on spaceborne fauna with the Fruitful Partnership origin, Humanoids exploring a new Enmity tradition tree, and Lithoids reaching new heights (or lows) of Xenophobia with the Selective Kinship civic. Egalitarian Megacorps can now be free of the shackles of their ruling class with the Worker Cooperative civic. Machines were left out of reanimation until now, but with the Mechromancy Ascension Perk added to Necroids, they too can get into the cyber-zombie fun.

Gestalts in general have access to more Origins than before, including Common Ground, Hegemony, Lost Colony, and Hive-Minds can now be Void Dwellers.

Major changes have been made to Habitats, which now group together to form a single Habitat Complex in a system, making their management (and invasion) less tedious. After building the central Complex, Major and Minor Orbitals can be built across the system to build up the network.

We've also made changes to trade, automation, performance, and AI, as well as added events, fixes, softened the effects of the 3.8 Leader Cap, and more - a lot more. For full details, see the forum link below.

Thanks for playing Stellaris, see you amongst the stars!
