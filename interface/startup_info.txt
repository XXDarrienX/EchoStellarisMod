Welcome to the Stellaris 3.8 "Gemini" and Galactic Paragons update!

Gemini brings cooperative gameplay to Stellaris with two different modes, where up to five players can work together within the same empire. Cooperative PvE, available from the main menu, gives you a new way to teach Stellaris to your friends - or when looking for a more leisurely game. Cooperative PvP gives you the option to have teams of players competing with each other, and is available as an option when hosting a standard Multiplayer game.

Among the many other changes in Gemini, leaders and governments have had major revisions, and a new system for notification and message filtering has been added. Please see the patch notes for full details on the many systems that have been improved.

The Galactic Paragons expansion builds upon these updates, greatly expanding the mechanics around leaders and the council, as well as adding legendary paragon leaders for you to meet and recruit.

Go forth and write your legend, together!

Thank you for playing Stellaris!
