As Canis Minor, the "little dog", follows the hunter Orion, the Stellaris team is proud to bring you the 3.7 "Canis Minor" update.

Canis Minor and the First Contact Story Pack focuses on exploring the fates of Pre-FTL civilizations in the Stellaris universe. The free Custodian release improves interactions with pre-FTL societies, while the Story Pack adds challenging origins like Payback and Broken Shackles, existential threats in Fear of the Dark, several new civics, and further expands upon the mechanics added in the Custodian release.

Collect observational insights while keeping them unaware, or reveal yourselves to them and make diplomatic pacts to bring them into the space age. Cloaking and Detection bring new strategies and counterstrategies to both exploration and war - a fleet of undetected Frigates can lay waste to critical bases in war, especially if the local detection arrays have been sabotaged.

The Custodians have also added content to Ancient Relics - completed Archaeology sites can now be further exploited for a trickle of Minor Artifacts, and Archaotechnologies have been introduced.

Look to the stars... For you are not alone. Thank you for playing Stellaris!
