Welcome back, Overlord!

The 3.4 "Cepheus" update includes major changes to subjugation and vassalization systems, including negotiation of agreement terms and introducing loyalty as a resource.

Planetary and Sector Automation have been unified under one improved system, with more options to give you control over what kinds of development are automated, and deficits and revolts now use a dedicated Situations system that support progressing effects as they build up over time.

The Overlord DLC itself includes advanced specialized subjects, five new origins, three new enclaves, and constructions like the Orbital Ring, Quantum Catapult, and Hyper Relay Network that help you enact your grand design for the galaxy.

The brightest star must guide them, shouldn't that be you?

Take a look at the patch notes using the link below for full details on the bugs we've exterminated, the ways we've improved AI, and other quality of life fixes and improvements in 3.4.

Thanks for playing Stellaris!
