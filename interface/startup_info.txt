Welcome to the Stellaris 3.11 "Eridanus" update!

The sixth largest constellation in the sky, Eridanus represents the celestial river, flowing from the waters poured by Aquarius.

This update has been focused primarily on stability, technology balancing, and bugfixing, and we have incorporated a number of fixes from our community modders. I want to take this opportunity to thank them again for helping us make Stellaris a better game.

Eridanus also brings a subscription option to Stellaris on some storefronts, granting access to all DLC while you are subscribed. For more information, see the Additional Content Browser.

A post with full details on the patch notes can be found on our forum. 

Thank you for playing Stellaris!
