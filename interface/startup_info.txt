Welcome to BioGenesis and the Stellaris 4.0 'Phoenix' update!

Metal rusts. Flesh adapts. The era of the machine is at an end.

BioGenesis introduces two biological shipsets with distinct mechanics from standard mechanical ships. The update also includes three new Origins and a comprehensive rework of the Genetic Ascension Path, bringing it in line with the Synthetic and Cybernetic overhauls introduced in The Machine Age. We've added a Hive Fallen Empire (or is it three?!), a robust selection of new Civics, more Advanced Government Types, and a new Crisis path that allows you to become the hunter - §CBehemoth Fury§!.

The 4.0 'Phoenix' update revamps Stellaris in several big ways - pops are now 100x as plentiful and form into Pop Groups, with simultaneous pop growth on multi-species planets and enhanced auto-migration. You'll now start with far more pops than before, many of whom are in a Civilian pool, eager for the chance for new opportunities as you expand to the stars.

The Planet UI has been revamped as well, allowing you to customize your Districts by specializing them the way you desire. As a general rule, Districts now provide jobs, Specializations change which jobs the Districts provide, and Buildings modify the jobs themselves, but can also provide static numbers of jobs if you need them in a pinch.

The Situation Log now features an Empire Timeline, chronicling key milestones throughout your empire's development. Additionally, new Empire Focuses have been introduced to provide clearer guidance for newer players, while also diminishing the role luck plays in acquiring critical Technologies.

This only scratches the surface of this update - please read the full patch notes or read our dev diaries for more details.

Thank you for embarking with us on this bold new chapter, as Stellaris evolves into its most ambitious form yet!
