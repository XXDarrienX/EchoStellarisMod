It is time to leave our flawed biological vessels behind. The Machine Age has begun!

Welcome to the Stellaris 3.12 'Andromeda' update alongside our newest Major Expansion, The Machine Age.

The Machine Age focuses primarily on cybernetics, synthetics, and machines - whether they be the technophants of the Cybernetic Creed, a desperate civilization racing against extinction in Synthetic Fertility, or individualistic machine Arc Welders building megastructures across the galaxy. Machine empires have many new options available to them as well, including brand new Modularity, Nanotech, and Virtuality Ascension Paths.

For the first time since the Contingency was introduced in the Stellaris 1.8 'Capek' release, a new End-Game Crisis has been unleashed. Imprisoned for countless millenia, an ancient threat emerges to throw the very meaning of life into question.

A transformative age is upon us, sparked by innovation and oiled by opportunity.

Thank you for playing Stellaris!
