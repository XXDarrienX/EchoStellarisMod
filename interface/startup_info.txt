Welcome to the Stellaris 3.14 'Circinus' update! 

The Grand Archive has opened its doors. Come and explore its wonders.

The Grand Archive Story Pack concludes Stellaris: Season 08 with an expansive new collection system, allowing players to gather and showcase specimens in their own Archive. With over 240 unique specimens scattered across the galaxy - each brimming with rich lore - this update offers a deeper dive into the mysteries of the Stellaris universe, spanning content both old and new.

The Archive also houses a Vivarium, enabling you to capture, clone, grow, and even mutate Space Fauna. Two new lifeforms now roam the galaxy - the stealthy Cutholoids and the ravenous Voidworms. But beware: if the Voidworms aren't carefully controlled, they could spiral into a mid-game Crisis, threatening the stability of your entire empire.

The Custodian team has revamped the Galaxy Settings screen for new game creation, offering a fresh and streamlined experience. And that's just the beginning of everything that's been done. For a full breakdown of all the changes, see the release notes below.

Thank you for playing Stellaris!
