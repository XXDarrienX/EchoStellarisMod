Greetings, interstellar explorers!

We're happy to inform you that the 3.5 "Fornax" update has arrived. Named by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, the Chemical Furnace is a symbol of the Age of Enlightenment and seemed an appropriate name for the free patch associated with the Toxoids Species Pack.

In the Custodian portion of this update we have new galaxy generation settings to allow better customization of the difficulty of the game - from the new Civilian difficulty setting to the ability to choose all end game crises to appear sequentially, growing in power with each one you defeat. We've also enhanced many relics, added new achievements for each Species Pack, and implemented numerous UI and AI improvements.

The Toxoids Species Pack includes a slimy yet satisfying set of portraits, a scavenged ship set, two new origins, civics, traits, and much more. These survivors will expend the future for gain today, making tough sacrifices necessary to survive a hostile galaxy.

The patch notes linked below include the full details on the many changes, bugfixes, and quality of life improvements in 3.5.

Burn brightly, and thanks for playing Stellaris!
