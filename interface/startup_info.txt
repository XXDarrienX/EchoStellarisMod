Welcome to the 3.6 "Orion" Open Beta!

We've updated the Beta with a number of fixes based on activity from the last week, please continue to use the feedback threads on our forums - it's been a tremendous amount of help.

Orion is planned for release before the end of the year, and includes a huge number of balance changes, especially related to fleet combat and ascensions. Check the forum for dev diaries that fully detail the changes.

This week's update include changes to combat movement (especially for ships using Artillery and Carrier combat computers, which will now attempt to maintain range), a fix to size damage scaling, the introduction of Text-to-Speech, major changes to Shroud Covenants, countless balance tweaks, and more.

Fight with honor, TURN OFF YOUR MODS, and thanks for playing Stellaris!
