Welcome to the Stellaris 3.13 'Vela' update! 

Cosmic Storms are making planetfall across the galaxy.

Our newest Mechanical Expansion, Cosmic Storms, is the second Episode of Stellaris: Season 08, and focuses primarily on making space weather a more impactful and strategically interesting system. From Radiant Storms that enhance station output to Stardust Storms that can mask your fleet presence, or even the dreaded Nexus Storm, eight new storms will change the galaxy as they spiral across the stars.

You can seek the ultimate thrill in the Storm Chaser Origin, or explore two new Precursors, three new Civics, and the Galactic Weather Control Ascension Perk.

Hunker down and shelter beneath your Planetary Shields or attract and ride the Storms!

Thank you for playing Stellaris!
