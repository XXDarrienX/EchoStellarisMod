The Stellaris Custodians are happy to bring you the 3.6 "Orion" free update. This update includes a large number of balance changes with a primary focus on ascensions and fleet combat.

For those of you that own the Utopia expansion, Ascension Paths have been changed from two Ascension Perks to a single one that unlocks a new Tradition tree. Synthetic Ascension has also been split into separate Synthetic and Cybernetic Ascension Paths, and hive and machine empires will find some new options available.

With the fleet combat rebalancing, mixed fleets containing several ship sizes should find themselves at an advantage over the fleets of the past, as stronger counters exist for many ship designs and they should be better able to cover for each other's weaknesses. Torpedoes are a serious threat to large ships, and it falls to Corvettes and Destroyers to stop the Frigates that carry them before they reach your line of Artillery Battleships. In the Ship Designer, you can now choose to automatically design ships towards filling these specific roles. Please see the full patch notes and dev diaries for more details.

Text-to-Speech support has also been added to portions of the game, and can be enabled in the Accessibility portion of Settings. Check it out and let us know what you think.

Thank you for playing Stellaris, and enjoy the hunt!
