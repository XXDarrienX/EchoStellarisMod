		species_bio="The Brotherhood of Nod was originally from Earth where they fought the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) over Tiberium. Nod had to leave Earth because GDI forces eventually overpowered and defeated them. 

The modern empire of the Brotherhood of Nod is made up of humans who have \"Ascended\" from Earth. Their planet Sarajevo is named after their first Headquarters on Earth. 

Their weapons are well known for using experimental and forbidden technology. They are well aware that the GDI still exist and they have been building up their new empire on Sarajevo to be able to compete with the new Galactic Defense Initiative.

The Brotherhood of Nod are from Command and Conquer. For best roleplaying, ensure that the Galactic Defense Initiative spawns in your game."
