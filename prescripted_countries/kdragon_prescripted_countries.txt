		species_bio="Kiev'arian Dragons are a breed of Dragon that reside upon the plane of kiev'ara. They were created by two brothers. Dra'ko and Saurav'ix. who held the mantle of life and death in the Primordial hierarchy. Kaiev'arian dragons exist in four different kingdoms. One for each of the four main elements 

the first creations that the kin had created were the prideful warrior cultured Fire dragons who valued power and strength overall. Their war-like nature and hierarchy proved them ample and fearless warriors giving them no fear in the face of danger with their skill in manipulating fire they were said to be able to craft and smelt metals into the finest of purity. Their scales were a  glimmering crimson with oranges like that of a flame  

 Next were The strong Earth dragons, with strength like no other to move mountains and shape the landscape to their whim. whose philosophical view on the world gave them valued knowledge over most everything. They had a unique view of the world and a desire to document and record knowledge so that it may be shared with the world and not forgotten. Their scales gleamed all shades of green and brown with orange mixtures.

The graceful and ever so ambitious water dragons are shy and naive with soft, tender hearts and vast knowledge and capabilities in the healing arts. with their deep blue scales, the intellectual water dragons matched the vast seas' in color. Their muscular webbed bodies allowed them to travel the water at high speeds. The strongest of them all was said to be able to create or re-direct water currents.

And at last and within their eyes, not the least of the dragon flights, we have the courageous and prideful air dragons who reside at the highest peaks where their large wings caught and controlled the realm's strong winds and maneuvered the air currents all around Kiev'ara. with their glimmering white and beige scales. They valued status, wealth, and personal reputation overall. However, they had great personalities themselves"
