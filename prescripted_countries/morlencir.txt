		species_bio="The elf-like Morlencir are bipedal humanoids standing roughly one and a half to two meters tall. Their skin color ranges through most browns and pinks, but can go as far as purple, black, and, on rare occasions, gold. Morlencir have four different hair and eye color chromosomes that combined can produce virtually any visible color. Sylir, the space-faring members of the Morlencir Empire are those who have abandoned the ties to their worlds in order to travel space freely. In exchange, they wear technologically advanced cysuits that usually take the form of dark form-fitting catsuits, but can vary in color, shape, and features by the wearer's needs and tastes."
