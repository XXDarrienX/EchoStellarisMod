		species_bio="The Scrin have been seeking resources throughout the galaxy for hundreds of years. Specifically, they seek out a specific resource called Tiberium, of which large quantities were discovered in the Sol system.

They were eventually discovered by GDI and Nod, and Nod decided to welcome the Scrin, becoming loyal to them for quite some time. Other than their interactions with humans, the Scrin are a mysterious species; not much is known about them.

The Scrin are from Command and Conquer. For best roleplaying, ensure that the Brotherhood of Nod spawns in your game."
