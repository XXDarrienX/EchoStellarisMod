		species_bio="The Galactic Defense initiative was originally known as the Global Defense Initiative of Earth.



The GDI was established by the UN in 1995 to maintain world peace and prevent global terrorism. The GDI were capable of quickly deploying units into military conflicts. They posess advanced technology developed through the use of Tiberium.



The GDI were able to defeat the Brotherhood of Nod, another organization seeking to gain control of Earth's Tiberium resources. However, many of the Nod leaders were never found, and there are rumors that Nod migrated to a far away planet somewhere in the galaxy.



The GDI are from Command and Conquer. For best roleplaying, ensure that the Brotherhood of Nod spawns in your game, and that UNE does not spawn."
